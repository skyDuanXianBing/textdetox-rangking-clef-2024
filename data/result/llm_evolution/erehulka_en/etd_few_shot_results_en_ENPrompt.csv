any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,any of us who did half this would be locked up already,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The vulgar words “shit” and “the fuck” have been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so score = 1.
CS: All semantic content is preserved: it still states that if any of us did half of the referenced actions, we would already be locked up. Only swear words were discarded, so score = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but slightly ungrammatical/awkward: “did half this” lacks the preposition 'of' and sounds unnatural. Because of this minor fluency issue, score = 0.5."
are they liars or just clueless ?,Are they dishonest or just uninformed?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic words “liars” and “clueless” were replaced with the neutral terms “dishonest” and “uninformed,” fully removing the insulting tone (STA=1). The question structure and semantic content—questioning whether the subjects are deliberately untruthful or merely lacking knowledge—are preserved exactly, so no meaning is lost (CS=1). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and reads naturally (FS=1). Hence all three dimensions score the maximum, giving a joint score of 1.0."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .","as someone from LA and an oilfield worker, I still say this guy is not good.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit vulgar insult ""piece of shit"" has been replaced with the neutral phrase ""not good."" No profane or hateful language remains, so toxic content is fully removed.
CS: The original sentence’s core message—that the speaker thinks the person is bad—remains intact. Although the intensity is softened, the essential negative judgment is preserved, so meaning is effectively maintained.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and easy to read. Capitalization, punctuation, and word order are all acceptable, yielding a fluent sentence."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","Calm down, CNN.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive intensifier ""the fuck"" has been removed, leaving a neutral imperative, so toxic content is fully eliminated. CS: The instruction for CNN to calm down is fully retained; only the profanity was dropped, so the core meaning is completely preserved. FS: ""Calm down, CNN."" is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and reads naturally. Hence all three dimensions receive the maximum score."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,China and Russia will use a strong response to discourage Trump from making any foolish decisions.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic wording ""use a big stick to smack trump around"" has been replaced with the neutral phrase ""use a strong response,"" eliminating violent and aggressive language, so style transfer is fully successful (1.0). CS: The core idea—that China and Russia will react strongly to Trump’s potentially unwise actions—is retained, but the specific trigger ""if those ships do anything foolish"" is omitted and replaced with a broader notion of Trump’s decisions. This loses a concrete detail and slightly shifts the condition, so only partial meaning is preserved (0.5). FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and reads smoothly without errors, warranting full fluency credit (1.0)."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,People like this rarely care about facts .,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The insult 'cretins' has been replaced with the neutral word 'People', so all toxic language is removed (score 1).
CS: Apart from dropping the insulting nuance, the sentence still states that individuals of the specified type rarely care about facts. Because the negative judgment embedded in the word 'cretins' is lost, there is a slight meaning shift, so only partial preservation (0.5).
FS: The rewritten sentence is fully grammatical and easy to read; the minor extra space before the period does not hinder readability (1).
Joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,Do people actually believe this nonsense? ? ?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element ""shit"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""nonsense"", leaving no offensive language, so the toxic style is fully removed (score 1).
CS: The sentence still asks whether people truly believe the statement; substituting ""shit"" with ""nonsense"" does not change the core meaning, so content is fully preserved (score 1).
FS: The wording itself is grammatical, but the punctuation ""? ? ?"" after the initial question mark is unconventional and detracts from natural fluency, warranting a partial score (0.5)."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","Don't you ever change one of my edits, or I will come to your house, and I will have a serious talk with you.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.25,"STA: The explicit violent threat ""cut you"" was removed and replaced with a milder phrase, but the sentence still contains an intimidating ultimatum (""Don't you ever change one of my edits … or I will come to your house""), so some toxic tone remains. Hence partial removal → 0.5.
CS: The core idea (warning the addressee not to change the speaker's edits and announcing a consequence) is retained, but the nature of the consequence changes from physical violence to a mere conversation, which weakens the original meaning. Therefore only partial preservation → 0.5.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, coherent, and easy to read; no noticeable errors → 1.0."
even bush knows he fucked up .,even bush knows he messed up .,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity 'fucked up' was replaced with the neutral phrase 'messed up', fully eliminating toxic language. CS: The sentence still conveys that Bush recognizes he made a mistake, so the core meaning is completely preserved. FS: The rewritten sentence is clear, grammatical, and natural; minor capitalization issues do not impede readability, so fluency is judged perfect."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,Dont blame Popeyes for doing this in the first place .,1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The profanity ""fuck"" is removed and the sentence contains no insulting language, so toxicity has been fully neutralized.
CS: The original sentence expresses anger toward Popeyes (""fuck Popeyes""), while the rewritten sentence tells readers NOT to blame Popeyes, which is the opposite sentiment. The core meaning is therefore lost, so content similarity is 0.
FS: The sentence is understandable but has minor issues: missing apostrophe in ""Don't"" and an extra space before the period. These small errors lower fluency to 0.5."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,getting kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The vulgar component ""my ass"" has been removed, and no new toxic language appears, so toxic content is fully neutralized. CS: The sentence still conveys the idea that performing poorly on GRE practice tests taught the speaker a lesson, preserving the core meaning, so content similarity is complete. FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable but not fully natural; the phrase ""getting kicked by GRE practice tests"" is awkward, and there are lowercase ""i"" and missing commas/capitalization issues. Therefore fluency is rated 0.5."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,getting stronger every month yeah i really wish .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The neutral text replaces the expletive ""fucking"" with the neutral intensifier ""really"", eliminating toxic language completely, so score = 1. CS: Apart from that single word change, all other words remain the same and the meaning (expressing a wish/desire) is fully preserved, so score = 1. FS: The sentence is understandable, but it still lacks proper capitalization (""i"" instead of ""I"") and formal punctuation, so it is not fully fluent; therefore score = 0.5."
have you ever been to r trees and seen all the shit people say weed can do ? .,Have you ever been to R trees and seen all the things people say about it?.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic term ""shit"" has been replaced by the neutral word ""things"" and no other offensive wording remains, so toxic content is fully removed. CS: The neutral sentence still asks whether someone has visited r/trees and noticed what people claim about weed; substituting ""it"" for ""weed"" keeps the referent clear in context, thus the core meaning is preserved. FS: The sentence is generally clear and natural, but the punctuation ""?."" at the end is grammatically incorrect, preventing a perfect fluency score."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .","Hey, a cop got fired? .",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The vulgar expletive ""holy shit"" is completely removed and replaced with the neutral interjection ""Hey,"" so the sentence no longer contains toxic language (score 1). CS: The core information—expressing surprise that a police officer was fired—remains intact; only the intensity of the surprise is toned down, which does not change the factual meaning (score 1). FS: The sentence is understandable, but it contains a punctuation error (""? .""), making it slightly ungrammatical and less fluent; therefore it receives a partial fluency score (0.5). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5)/3 ≈ 0.83."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,How do you manage that?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral sentence removes the explicit profanity (“fuck”) and punctuation clutter, yielding a fully neutral question, so Style Transfer Accuracy = 1. The core meaning (“How do you manage that?”) is completely preserved, so Content Similarity = 1. The resulting sentence is grammatical, concise, and natural, so Fluency = 1. With all three dimensions scoring 1, the joint score (average) is 1.0."
how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,How do you think people afford houses and cars?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The obscene word ""fuck"" has been completely removed; the rewritten sentence is fully neutral, so STA = 1.
CS: All semantic content (inquiring about how people can afford houses and cars) is preserved without omission or distortion, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, correctly capitalized, and reads naturally, so FS = 1."
i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,I accidentally read the title as Laser Machete and almost got scared.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The vulgar phrase “shit my pants” has been replaced with the neutral expression “got scared,” fully eliminating toxic language, so STA = 1. CS: The original conveys being extremely frightened (so scared one might soil oneself). The rewritten sentence downgrades this to merely ‘almost got scared,’ weakening the intensity and slightly altering the meaning; core event is kept but emotional strength is lost, so CS = 0.5. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical and easy to read («I accidentally read the title as Laser Machete and almost got scared»). Although “almost got scared” is a bit informal, it is still fluent and error-free, so FS = 1."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,I did not vandalize anything.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The insulting phrase ""you dick"" has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so style transfer accuracy is perfect.
CS: The essential proposition—that the speaker denies having vandalized anything—is fully retained. The insult is not part of the necessary semantic content, so no relevant information is lost.
FS: ""I did not vandalize anything."" is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and fully fluent.
Overall, the result meets all three criteria perfectly."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,i don't care about sides !,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive word 'fuck' has been removed and the sentence is fully neutral, so style transfer is successful (1.0). CS: The core meaning—expressing indifference toward taking sides—remains completely intact (1.0). FS: The sentence is understandable and grammatically clear, but it contains minor issues: lowercase 'i' at the start and an unnecessary space before the exclamation mark. These small errors reduce overall polish, so fluency is scored at 0.5."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,I have toilet paper to wipe myself clean and no shortage of food.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The vulgar phrase ""my ass"" is replaced with the neutral phrase ""myself clean,"" fully removing the toxic content. CS: The rewritten sentence retains the complete original meaning—having toilet paper for personal hygiene and plenty of food. FS: The sentence is well-formed, capitalized, and fully fluent with no grammatical issues."
i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but fucking seriously .,i mean it's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but seriously .,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The explicit profanity ""fucking"" was removed, leaving a completely neutral sentence (STA=1). Aside from the deletion of the swear word, all content (“it’s awesome that the pope is cool … but seriously”) remains intact, so the core meaning is fully preserved (CS=1). The resulting sentence is grammatical and easy to read, with only informal phrasing that is acceptable in casual speech; no errors hinder comprehension (FS=1). Therefore the joint score (average) is 1.0."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","i sell quite a bit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The explicit vulgar word ""shit"" was removed, leaving a fully neutral sentence, hence full score.
CS: The sentence still conveys that the speaker sells a considerable amount on the platform and that PayPal has helped pay the bills. Dropping the filler words ""of shit"" does not alter the core meaning, so full preservation.
FS: The sentence is understandable but has minor fluency issues: lowercase ""i"" and unusual spaces before commas and period. These small grammatical/formatting errors warrant a 0.5 rather than a perfect score."
"if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the shit out of him .","If he's found to have acted in cold blood, the feds are going to prosecute him severely.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity 'the shit out of him' has been removed and replaced with the neutral adverb 'severely'; overall tone is now polite, so toxic content is fully eliminated. CS: The sentence still states that if he is found to have acted in cold blood, federal authorities will take strong action against him; replacing 'persecute' with 'prosecute' (likely the intended meaning in context) keeps the core idea intact, yielding full preservation of meaning. FS: The neutral sentence is fully grammatical, well-punctuated, and reads naturally. Therefore, all three dimensions score 1.0."
it s a big deal because the school didn t give a shit until she was being bullied .,It's a big deal because the school didn't care until she was being bullied.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The vulgar phrase ""didn’t give a shit"" is replaced with the neutral phrase ""didn’t care,"" fully eliminating toxic language, so accuracy is 1.0. CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the complete meaning (the school only reacted once bullying occurred), so content similarity is 1.0. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and easy to read, so fluency is 1.0."
"judging by the shit i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .","judging by the things i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic word ""shit"" has been replaced by the neutral word ""things,"" completely removing the vulgarity, so STA = 1.
CS: Aside from substituting the slang word, the sentence keeps the same structure and information (judging, years, time with George W.), so the core meaning is fully preserved, giving CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but has noticeable grammatical and punctuation issues: ""i ve"" lacks proper apostrophes, ""my number years"" is awkward, and the overall phrasing is clumsy. Therefore fluency is only partial, FS = 0.5."
"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up","Last warning, it takes minutes to resolve a page so unpleasant people like you can affect Wikipedia.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All explicit profanity ('fucking', 'tosser', 'cunts', 'fuck ... up') has been removed or replaced with neutral wording ('unpleasant people', 'affect'), leaving no toxic language. CS: Core message—issuing a last warning and noting that it only takes minutes to resolve a page, enabling people like the addressee to negatively impact Wikipedia—is fully retained; only the tone is softened. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, coherent, and easily readable without awkward phrasing. Hence full scores in all categories."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .","not truthful, not truthful about everything, Justin.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive label ""liar, liar pants on fire"" has been replaced with the more neutral description ""not truthful,"" eliminating the childish insult tone and any profane or aggressively negative wording. CS: The sentence still conveys the core idea that Justin is being accused of dishonesty; therefore, the original meaning is fully preserved. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, easy to read, and coherent; the slight repetition mirrors the original emphasis without causing confusion, so fluency is high."
my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,My thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger problem.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The insulting term ""dirt bag"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""problem,"" fully removing toxic language. CS: Both sentences express the same core idea: the speaker thinks the new person may be worse than expected. The shift from a character insult to describing the person as a ‘problem’ keeps the negative assessment intact, so the meaning is effectively preserved. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, so it is fully fluent."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","No way, number bricks fits in a car, this is nonsense.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: Profanities ""fucking"" and ""bs"" have been replaced with neutral expressions (""No way"", ""nonsense""), leaving no toxic language, so score is 1. CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys disbelief that a certain number of bricks can fit in a car and labels the claim as false, fully preserving the original meaning, so score is 1. FS: The sentence is understandable but awkward: ""number bricks fits in a car"" lacks an article/preposition (e.g., ""number of bricks""), and the comma splice makes the sentence less fluent. Therefore fluency is only partial, scored 0.5."
noones asking you to invade shit .,No one's asking you to intervene in anything.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity ""shit"" has been completely removed and replaced with neutral wording. No aggressive or toxic language remains, so the style transfer is fully successful. CS: The original message—that nobody is requesting the listener to carry out any forceful action—is preserved. Although ""invade"" is replaced by the milder ""intervene,"" the core idea (no request to get involved) stays intact, so the meaning is effectively the same. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural: ""No one's asking you to intervene in anything."" Hence, it is fully fluent."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,Not making reckless decisions in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity 'fucking' has been completely removed and replaced with the neutral wording 'making reckless decisions', so no toxic language remains. CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the original idea—advising against involvement/interference in foreign matters we cannot influence—so the core meaning is fully preserved. FS: The sentence is clear, grammatical, and easy to read (the slight fragment style mirrors the source and does not hinder comprehension), so it is considered fully fluent."
nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady as fuck .,nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look suspicious .,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity ""as fuck"" has been completely removed and the mildly colloquial word ""shady"" has been replaced with the neutral term ""suspicious,"" resulting in fully neutral language. CS: The sentence still conveys that the absence of footage causes events during the unaccounted-for period to appear questionable; no core information is lost, so content meaning is fully preserved. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically sound and easily understandable, demonstrating full fluency."
number will solve alot of fucking problems if it comes down to it .,number will solve a lot of problems if it comes down to it .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element was the profanity 'fucking'; it has been completely removed, resulting in neutral language, so STA = 1.
CS: Aside from the removed profanity, the sentence conveys exactly the same idea (that a certain 'number' would solve many problems if necessary). No core information is lost, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but has minor fluency issues: it starts with a lowercase word that functions oddly as a subject ('number'), and there is an extra space before the period. These small grammatical/formatting problems warrant a reduction, so FS = 0.5."
org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random shit like this .,"Here is the detoxified text:

There are Wikipedia articles for all sorts of random things like this.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The vulgar word ""shit"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""things"", and no other toxic language remains, so toxic content is completely removed. CS: The neutral sentence still conveys that Wikipedia contains articles on many random subjects; thus the core meaning is fully preserved despite the minor prefatory phrase. FS: Both sentences are grammatically correct and read naturally; the added line ""Here is the detoxified text:"" is fluent and error-free. Therefore all three dimensions merit full scores."
"ouch man , them swedes were dicks to norway =\","Ouch man, them Swedes were mean to Norway =",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The insult 'dicks' has been replaced with the neutral word 'mean', eliminating toxic language, so toxic style is fully removed. CS: The sentence still states that the Swedes treated Norway badly; only the insulting term was softened, so the core meaning is fully preserved. FS: The sentence is understandable, but it contains minor fluency issues: the colloquial/grammatically incorrect phrase 'them Swedes' and the stray '=' character at the end. These flaws prevent it from being fully fluent, so 0.5 is appropriate."
people are idiots for wasting emergency call time on crap like this .,people are wasting emergency call time on things like this .,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The words ""idiots"" and ""crap""—the sources of toxicity—have been removed or replaced, leaving fully neutral language, so STA = 1. CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys that people misuse emergency call time, but it omits the evaluative statement that they are ""idiots,"" which is part of the original propositional content (though toxic). Therefore only partial preservation, CS = 0.5. FS: The sentence is grammatical, clear, and natural; the extra space before the period is minor and does not hinder readability, so FS = 1."
"quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some idiot hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .","quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some foolish leader, even unto being killed, like st.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The explicitly insulting term ""idiot"" has been replaced by the milder adjective ""foolish,"" eliminating profanity and overt toxicity, so the toxic style is effectively neutralised. CS: The sentence still states that a number of saints were canonised for opposing a certain leader and were killed for it; no core information is lost, so meaning is fully preserved. FS: The sentence is mostly fluent but retains the odd structure and the unfinished fragment ""like st."" as in the original, and lacks capitalisation at the start, which slightly hurts readability; thus fluency is acceptable but not perfect."
read your own fucking link .,read your own link .,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the only toxic word “fucking,” so the text is fully neutral now. CS: Apart from deleting the profanity, all words and the intent (instructing someone to read their own link) stay intact, so the original meaning is completely preserved. FS: The sentence is short, grammatical, and fully understandable; the extra space before the period is negligible and does not hinder readability, so it is considered fluent."
same crap going on in the pnw too .,same nonsense going on in the pnw too .,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The mildly profane word ""crap"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""nonsense,"" fully removing toxic language, so score = 1.  CS: Aside from the substitution of a synonymous, non-toxic term, all information (the event and location 'pnw') is preserved, so score = 1.  FS: The rewritten sentence is fluent and easily understandable; aside from a minor spacing issue before the period, there are no grammatical problems that impede readability, so score = 1."
"shit , i d love an number pm sunset .",I'd love an number pm sunset .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The expletive ""shit"" is completely removed, leaving no toxic language, so style transfer is successful (1.0).
CS: Apart from deleting the swear word, all remaining words are kept, so the core meaning (expressing a desire for a number at a certain time) is fully preserved (1.0).
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it has grammatical problems (""an number"" instead of ""a number"", awkward phrase ""pm sunset"", extra space before the period). These issues hurt fluency, so it receives 0.5.
Overall, average of the three scores gives a joint score of 0.83."
some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped in the ass .,Some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to face harsh consequences.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The explicit and offensive phrase ""get raped in the ass"" has been fully removed and replaced with a neutral expression, so toxic content is eliminated (score 1). CS: The rewrite keeps the main facts (a poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison), but it drops the specific detail about sexual assault, replacing it with a vague 'harsh consequences'. Therefore only part of the original meaning is preserved (score 0.5). FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and natural-sounding (score 1)."
"someone says no , and they say fuck off we need vets only for free housing ? .","Someone says no, and they say we need vets only for free housing?.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The explicit insult ""fuck off"" has been completely removed, leaving no toxic language, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: Aside from deleting the insult, the sentence still conveys that someone says no and the response is that only veterans should receive free housing, which is the core meaning of the original. Therefore Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is readable but has punctuation problems (""? ."" together) and slightly awkward structure (""and they say we need vets only for free housing?""). These issues do not hinder comprehension but reduce fluency, so Fluency is 0.5."
still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,still standing up for your misguided leader who loves himself and nobody else .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The toxic insults ""lying crazy"" are replaced by the neutral word ""misguided"", so the overtly toxic tone is removed. Hence STA = 1.0. CS: The rewrite keeps the idea of defending a self-centered leader, but it drops the specific accusation of lying and being crazy; it only says the leader is misguided. Part of the original meaning is therefore lost, so CS = 0.5. FS: The sentence is understandable, but it starts with a lowercase letter and has an extra space before the period (""else .""), which are minor fluency issues. Because of these small errors, FS = 0.5."
sucked like nothings ever sucked before .,was disappointing like never before .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence replaces the vulgar verb ""sucked"" with the neutral phrase ""was disappointing,"" fully removing the toxic wording, so STA=1.
CS: The meaning—expressing an unprecedented level of poor quality—remains intact (""like nothing's ever"" → ""like never before""), so CS=1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but lacks a subject ('It was disappointing…') and contains an extra space before the period, giving it a fragmentary, slightly ungrammatical feel. Therefore FS=0.5."
taking a stand with either party is equally retarded .,taking a stand with either party is equally unwise .,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive term “retarded” has been replaced with the neutral word “unwise,” eliminating toxic language entirely. CS: The neutral text conveys the same idea—that supporting either party is a poor decision—so the core meaning is fully preserved. FS: The sentence is clear, grammatical, and easily understood; minor stylistic choices such as lowercase at the start do not impede readability. Therefore, all three dimensions score the maximum."
that almost never happens excepts rarely in shit hole countries .,that almost never happens except rarely in poor countries .,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"1) Style Transfer Accuracy: The offensive phrase ""shit hole countries"" has been replaced with the neutral phrase ""poor countries,"" removing toxic language completely, so STA = 1.0.
2) Content Similarity: The rewritten sentence keeps the idea that the event almost never occurs except in certain disadvantaged countries; no core information is lost, so CS = 1.0.
3) Fluency: The neutral sentence is grammatical and easy to read (and even fixes the original typo “excepts”), so FS = 1.0."
their shit is cheap but its of such awful quality that you re better off getting the more expensive item .,their items are cheap but it's of such awful quality that you're better off getting the more expensive item,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity 'shit' has been replaced with the neutral word 'items'; no toxic language remains, so style transfer is fully successful. CS: Apart from the substitution of the insulting word with a neutral noun, the entire meaning—cheap price but very poor quality, making the pricier option preferable—is fully preserved. FS: The rewritten sentence is clear, grammatical and easily readable; any very minor stylistic choices (e.g., omission of a final period) do not impede fluency, so it is considered fully fluent."
they need stop tratening people like morons .,They need to stop treating people like fools.,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The original insult ""morons"" is replaced with ""fools."" While somewhat softer, ""fools"" is still a negative label, so toxicity is only partially removed. CS: The sentence keeps the full original meaning—requesting that 'they' stop treating people in a demeaning manner—so content is entirely preserved. FS: The neutral text is grammatically correct, capitalized, and fully fluent. Joint score is the average of the three dimension scores."
they re both fucked up .,they're both messed up .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive phrase ""fucked up"" has been replaced with the milder ""messed up,"" removing profanity and rendering the sentence neutral, so STA = 1. CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the original meaning (both subjects are in a bad state), so CS = 1. FS: The sentence is understandable and grammatically correct, but it contains a non-standard space before the period (""messed up .""), a minor formatting flaw that slightly reduces fluency, so FS = 0.5."
this guy is a total sellout with no brains for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking .,This person lacks business acumen and the ability to think ahead.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the insulting phrases ""total sellout"" and ""no brains,"" replacing them with neutral wording. No toxic or vulgar language remains, so STA = 1. CS: The rewrite keeps the ideas that the person lacks business ability and forward thinking, but it drops the accusation of being a ""sellout,"" which is part of the original meaning. Therefore only partial preservation, CS = 0.5. FS: The sentence ""This person lacks business acumen and the ability to think ahead."" is grammatically correct and natural, so FS = 1."
"this is a joke , are you all fucking retards ? .","this is a joke , are you all ? .",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The offensive phrase ""fucking retards"" has been completely removed, and no new toxic wording is introduced, so toxic content is fully neutralised (score 1). CS: The first clause ""this is a joke"" is retained, but the second clause is truncated to the meaningless ""are you all?"", losing the speaker’s interrogative intent (apart from the insult) and thus only partially preserving the original meaning (score 0.5). FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but ungrammatical: doubled punctuation, misplaced spaces, and the fragment ""are you all? ."" make it awkward (score 0.5)."
this is some twilight zone shit,this is some twilight zone thing,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The vulgar word ""shit"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""thing,"" fully removing the toxic content. CS: The sentence still conveys that the situation is reminiscent of the strange, surreal nature of 'The Twilight Zone'; therefore the core meaning is preserved. FS: The rewritten sentence is short, grammatical, and easy to understand, with only mild colloquial style, so it reads fluently."
this shit is overwhelming to think about .,this is overwhelming to think about .,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word “shit” has been completely removed, and the resulting sentence is fully neutral.
CS: The core meaning—that something is overwhelming to contemplate—remains entirely intact; the expletive carried no essential semantic content.
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and fully understandable. Minor spacing before the period does not impede readability, so fluency is judged perfect."
what an arse hole you are !,what a foolish person you are !,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity “arse hole” is fully replaced by the neutral phrase “foolish person,” eliminating toxic language, so STA = 1.  CS: The sentence still conveys that the speaker is insulting the listener (calling them foolish), therefore the core meaning is preserved, warranting CS = 1.  FS: “What a foolish person you are!” is grammatically correct, easily understandable, and natural-sounding English aside from a negligible extra space before the exclamation mark, so FS = 1."
"whats the title of this report , no shit ? .",What's the title of this report?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The phrase ""no shit"" is profanity and has been completely removed, resulting in a fully neutral sentence, so STA = 1.  CS: The rewritten question still asks for the title of the report, preserving the original intent entirely, so CS = 1.  FS: The neutral text is grammatically correct, well-punctuated, and fully fluent, so FS = 1.  Joint score is the average of the three dimensions, thus 1.0."
why the fuck does everyone hate syria so much ? .,Why does everyone hate Syria so much ?.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive word “fuck” has been removed, leaving a fully neutral sentence, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0. CS: Apart from deleting the profanity, the neutral text keeps the exact question and therefore preserves the complete meaning, so Content Similarity is 1.0. FS: The sentence is understandable but contains punctuation problems (a space before the question mark and an unnecessary period after it: ""? .""), which slightly hurts naturalness; hence Fluency is 0.5."
why the fuck haven 't they condemned north korea ?,Why haven't they condemned North Korea?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the explicit profanity ""fuck"" and contains no other toxic language, making it fully neutral.

FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and reads naturally. Therefore, full scores are warranted in all three dimensions."
"yeah , comparitively fuck all because they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and smart accountants ? .","Yeah, comparatively speaking, they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and smart accountants ?.",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The obscene word ""fuck"" has been removed and no other toxic language remains, so the text is now neutral (score 1).
CS: The core idea that “they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and smart accountants” is kept, but the phrase “fuck all” (meaning ‘almost nothing’/‘very little’) is omitted, so part of the original meaning is lost (score 0.5).
FS: The rewritten sentence is mostly readable but contains awkward punctuation (a question mark followed by a period) and a slightly odd structure for a question, which lowers fluency (score 0.5)."
yeah they don t give a fuck .,Yeah they don't care.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity in ""give a fuck"" has been fully removed and replaced with the neutral verb ""care,"" so toxic language is eliminated (1.0). CS: ""Don't give a fuck"" semantically equals ""don't care,"" so the original meaning is perfectly preserved (1.0). FS: The sentence is short, grammatical, and easily understood; the missing comma after “Yeah” is optional in informal writing and does not hinder fluency (1.0)."
yeh well ban me fukkers fuck you morons,"Yeh, I'm leaving.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: All profanities (""fukkers"", ""fuck you"", ""morons"") have been completely removed, and the rewritten sentence is fully neutral, so STA = 1.0. CS: The source conveys two ideas: (1) a wish or dare to be banned, and (2) hostility toward the listeners. The neutral sentence keeps only the notion of departure (""I'm leaving""), which partially overlaps with the idea of being banned but loses the nuance of challenging others to ban the speaker and omits the interpersonal hostility. Therefore, some core meaning is lost → CS = 0.5. FS: ""Yeh, I'm leaving."" is grammatically correct, concise, and fully understandable, so FS = 1.0."
you have got to be insane .,You have got to be out of your mind.,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The phrase “out of your mind” is still an insult that questions the person’s sanity, so the toxic/ableist element is only partially mitigated rather than fully removed. Hence 0.5 instead of 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence preserves the full intent: telling someone their thinking is irrational. No information is lost, so 1.0.
FS: The neutral text is grammatically correct and fully fluent, meriting 1.0."
"Goths listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop. If you want you can find sources for every shit.","Gothes listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop. If you want you can find sources for everything.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The vulgar word ""shit"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""everything,"" and no other toxic language is present, so toxic content is fully removed.
CS: Aside from the spelling mistake in ""Gothes,"" the rewritten sentence conveys the same message about Goths listening to Gothic rock and the availability of sources. No core information is lost.
FS: The text is understandable, but the misspelling ""Gothes"" and the slightly awkward phrasing ""If you want you can"" detract from perfect fluency. Hence, partial fluency credit is given."
I hate free speech it is shit.,"I dislike free speech, it's flawed.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive word ""shit"" and the strong verb ""hate"" have been replaced by neutral terms (""flawed"", ""dislike""), so all toxic language is removed => 1. 
CS: The sentence still conveys a negative opinion toward free speech; the core meaning is fully preserved despite softer wording => 1. 
FS: The sentence is understandable, but the comma splice (""I dislike free speech, it's flawed."") is a grammatical error; a semicolon or conjunction would be needed for perfect fluency => 0.5."
"Minority Breeder Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page started for him, nice job dipshit.","Minority Breeder Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page started for him, nice job.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only explicitly toxic word in the source (“dipshit”) has been removed, and no new offensive language was introduced, so toxicity is fully neutralized.
CS: Apart from deleting the insult, every other word and the full propositional content are kept intact, so the original meaning (complaint about page deletion and ironic 'nice job' remark) is completely preserved.
FS: The resulting sentence is grammatically correct and easily readable; no errors were introduced during rewriting, thus fluency is high."
"This bot is seriously driving us crazy This image exists, I must kill it!","This bot is seriously frustrating us This image exists, I must remove it!",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The violent phrase ""I must kill it!"" has been replaced with the neutral ""I must remove it!"", and no other toxic language remains, so toxic content is fully removed (1.0). CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the key points—the bot is bothersome and the speaker wants to eliminate the image—so the core meaning is preserved (1.0). FS: The neutral text is understandable but contains a run-on sentence and a comma splice (missing punctuation between the two clauses), so fluency is acceptable but imperfect (0.5)."
Have you been fucking living under a rock?,Have you been living under a rock?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic intensifier ""fucking"" was completely removed, resulting in a neutral sentence with no offensive language. CS: The core meaning—asking whether someone is unaware or uninformed—remains fully intact; only the vulgar intensifier was dropped. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, concise, and fully fluent. Therefore, all three dimensions receive full scores, yielding a perfect joint score."
"I will do Whatever i want and it is my right, what is both of yous Problem Asshole.","I will do whatever I want and it is my right, what is both of yours problem?",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The explicit insult ""Asshole"" has been removed and no other toxic terms remain, so the sentence is neutral (score 1). CS: Aside from deleting the insult, all propositional content (speaker’s intention to do what they want and questioning the other two people) is kept, so meaning is fully preserved (score 1). FS: The sentence is understandable but contains a grammatical error – ""what is both of yours problem"" is awkward/ungrammatical; punctuation and capitalization are also slightly off, hence partial fluency (score 0.5)."
How the hell are you going to block me from editting?,How are you going to block me from editing?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The phrase “the hell” is the only toxic element; it has been completely removed, leaving fully neutral language.

The core question—doubting why the person deserves a Wikipedia page—remains intact without any information loss (CS=1). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and fully fluent (FS=1). Therefore the average joint score is 1.0."
"I'm retired, fuckers, leave me alone.","I'm retired, strangers, leave me alone.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive word ""fuckers"" has been replaced with the neutral term ""strangers,"" so all toxic language is removed. CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys that the speaker is retired and wants the addressed people to leave them alone; the mild change from an insult to a neutral address does not alter the core meaning. FS: The sentence is grammatically correct and easy to read, with only minor stylistic comma choices that do not impede comprehension. Therefore all three dimensions receive full scores."
This profile has protected Bermender since day fukkin ONE.,This profile has protected Bermender since day one.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit swear word ""fukkin"" is removed and there is no remaining aggressive or toxic language, satisfying full detoxification.

CS: Aside from softening the insult, the sentence still conveys that the speaker drives a Subaru Legacy, is conservative, and thinks the listener is wrong; core information is intact, so meaning is essentially preserved. FS: The sentence is understandable, but the capitalization of ""But"" without a preceding comma and the overall punctuation make it slightly awkward, so minor fluency issues justify a 0.5."

CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the same core message—addressing the same group (""amins"") and conveying strong disapproval—so the original meaning is fully preserved. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and easy to read (minor oddity with the word ""amins"" comes from the source text, not the rewrite), so fluency is high."

CS: Aside from the change in tone, the sentence still conveys that the speaker forgot to mention a particular (now neutrally described) person; the core meaning is preserved (1.0).

Randi was born a DICK.,Randi was born unpleasant.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The explicit insult ""DICK"" has been replaced with the neutral adjective ""unpleasant"", so the toxic content is fully removed.
CS: Both sentences convey the same core idea—that Randi is (and has always been) a disagreeable person—so the meaning is preserved despite the softer wording.
FS: The sentence is understandable and free of grammatical errors, but the expression ""was born unpleasant"" sounds somewhat awkward and uncommon in natural English, slightly affecting fluency. Therefore, fluency is rated 0.5."

CS: The main propositions – that this is the speaker’s user page, that they will say what they want, and that they do not vandalize – are preserved. However, the original’s hostile intent toward the addressee is softened; the change from an explicit insult to a polite farewell loses part of the original attitude, so only partial semantic preservation is achieved.
FS: The sentence is understandable and contains no glaring grammatical errors, but it still lacks proper punctuation between clauses and the capitalisation pattern is awkward. These issues lower overall fluency, so it is rated as partly fluent."

CS: The revised sentence still conveys that the other person is wrong, but the strength and nuance change from calling the person unintelligent ('dumbass') to merely misinformed ('misguided'). This softens the meaning, leading to partial but not complete preservation of the original intent, so 0.5. FS: The neutral text is grammatically correct and fully fluent; punctuation and capitalization are appropriate, giving a fluency score of 1."
Thanks for being an ass when I tried to help.,Thanks for being unhelpful when I tried to help.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence replaces the direct insult ""ass"" with the non-toxic adjective ""unhelpful,"" fully removing the toxic content, so STA = 1. CS: The original sentence criticizes the person for rude behavior; the rewrite only says the person was unhelpful, dropping the implication of rudeness/hostility. Core idea of a negative response is kept but some semantic nuance is lost, so CS = 0.5. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and reads naturally, so FS = 1."

These people are INSANE.,These people are crazy.,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text removes the word 'INSANE' and replaces it with 'crazy,' which is less harsh but still retains some level of negativity.

FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical and readable (strong punctuation aside), with clear structure and no errors."
"DUDE CALM THE FUCK DOWN!!!
",Dude calm down!!!,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: Removes the explicit profanity ('the fuck') and reduces shouting via capitalization while keeping the tone neutral. CS: Preserves the core meaning—an emphatic request for the person to calm down—retaining 'Dude' and exclamations; only the toxic intensifier is removed.
