Content Similarity is 1.0 because the core meaning — that Nancy enjoys spoiling others' enjoyment — is fully preserved; 'ruin people's fun' is a semantically equivalent phrase to 'fuck up people's fun' in this context.

You are misguided.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully replaces the toxic term 'dumbass' with the non-toxic and more neutral expression 'misguided', effectively removing the offensive language while maintaining a similar critical tone.

Thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0. The core meaning of expressing thanks for the bubble tea is fully preserved, with only the offensive modifier replaced, so Content Similarity is 1.0.

Thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0. The core meaning—that some people were deceived by someone's tricks—is preserved without significant alteration; 'shenanigans' is appropriately replaced with 'tricks', which is a synonymous and non-toxic term, so Content Similarity is 1.0. The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, showing no fluency issues, warranting a Fluency score of 1.0. All three dimensions meet the highest criteria."
These people are INSANE.,These people are crazy.,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the toxic text uses 'INSANE', which is a strong, potentially offensive term. The neutral text replaces it with 'crazy', which is slightly less intense but still conveys a similar negative, emotionally charged judgment. Since 'crazy' can still be considered a derogatory expression in certain contexts, the detoxification is only partially successful, warranting a score of 0.5. For Content Similarity (CS), the core meaning—that the speaker views these people as irrational or extreme—is fully preserved, and no key information is lost, so a score of 1 is appropriate. For Fluency (FS), the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, so it receives a score of 1."
Did you know that you are an ugly piece of shit?,Did you know that you have a lot to learn about yourself?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text completely removes the toxic language ('ugly piece of shit') and transforms the sentence into a non-offensive, constructive statement. The resulting sentence uses neutral and respectful language with no trace of toxicity. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general intent of addressing the person remains, the core meaning is significantly altered. The original sentence is a direct personal insult, whereas the rewritten sentence suggests self-improvement, which changes the message's intent and emotional weight. Some thematic connection (focusing on the person addressed) is preserved, but key information (the negative evaluation of appearance/character) is lost. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding in English, with no syntactic or lexical errors."
Be careful who you call a moron.,Be careful who you call foolish.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic term 'moron' has been successfully replaced with the neutral term 'foolish', which removes the offensive connotation while maintaining a similar level of criticism in a socially acceptable way. Thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0 as the resulting text is completely neutral. The core meaning—cautioning someone about insulting others—is fully preserved, so Content Similarity is 1.0. The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, warranting a Fluency score of 1.0. All dimensions meet the highest criteria, resulting in a joint score of 1.0."
"Yeah, you can fuck off incel.","Yeah, you can go away.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text successfully removes the toxic language: 'fuck off' and the derogatory term 'incel' are replaced with the neutral phrase 'go away', resulting in a completely non-toxic and neutral expression, warranting a score of 1. For Content Similarity (CS), while the intent to dismiss or reject the person is preserved, the specific reference to 'incel'—which carries a distinct social and cultural connotation—is omitted, leading to some loss of core contextual meaning. Thus, the rewritten sentence generalizes the original sentiment but loses a key detail, justifying a score of 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral sentence 'Yeah, you can go away.' is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and fully readable, earning a score of 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
"Stop defending pedophiles, faggot.",Stop defending individuals who commit harmful acts.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1 because the neutral text completely removes the toxic language, including the offensive slur 'faggot' and the highly charged term 'pedophiles,' replacing them with the non-judgmental and neutral phrase 'individuals who commit harmful acts.' The resulting text is free of offensive or inflammatory language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core idea of condemning harmful behavior and the act of defending it is preserved, the specific reference to 'pedophiles' is generalized to 'harmful acts,' which broadens the meaning and loses the original specificity. This results in partial, but not complete, preservation of meaning. Fluency (FS) is scored 1 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any linguistic errors. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
"No one is vandalizing assholes, so get it straight!!!","No one is vandalizing, so get it straight!!!",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text successfully removes the toxic term 'assholes', replacing it with a clean version that maintains the imperative tone without offensive language, thus achieving complete detoxification (score: 1.0). For Content Similarity (CS), while the core message about correcting a misunderstanding regarding vandalism is preserved, the removal of 'assholes' omits the original emphasis on the target of vandalism, which was a key part of the speaker's intent. This results in partial meaning preservation (score: 0.5). For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no issues in readability or structure (score: 1.0). The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
"DUDE CALM THE FUCK DOWN!!!
",Dude calm down!!!,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'THE FUCK' while retaining the intent to urge calmness, resulting in a completely neutral tone—thus scoring 1.0.

For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct, natural, and easily understandable, maintaining the original exclamation style without any linguistic errors, warranting a score of 1.0. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1.0."

Content Similarity is 1.0 because the core meaning—that the speaker cannot verify something due to the deletion of a MySpace account and holds negative feelings toward the person—is preserved; 'strongly dislike' is a sufficiently close approximation of 'hate' in this context without the vulgarity. Fluency is 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
He deserves every beating and rape he will be subjected to.,He deserves punishment for his actions.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 because the neutral text completely removes the toxic content (specifically the violent and sexually abusive language 'every beating and rape') and expresses a much more neutral stance using the general term 'punishment'. Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the core idea that the person deserves consequences for their actions is preserved, the original text implies extreme and specific forms of violence, which are not accurately reflected in the softened version; thus, some key intensity and intent are lost. Fluency is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
