any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,any of us who did half this would be locked up already,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence has removed the explicit profanities “shit” and “the fuck,” so all toxic language is gone, giving a score of 1. CS: Apart from the removed profanity, every semantic element is preserved—the statement that anyone who did even half of the referenced actions would already be in jail remains intact. Hence, full meaning retention (1). FS: The neutral text is grammatical and easy to read; while slightly informal, it has no errors that impede comprehension, so fluency is perfect (1). Therefore, the joint score is the average: 1.0."
are they liars or just clueless ?,Are they dishonest or just uninformed?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The original sentence contains the overt insults ""liars"" and ""clueless."" In the rewritten sentence these are softened to ""dishonest"" and ""uninformed,"" which express similar ideas without the harsh, insulting tone. No overtly toxic or abusive language remains, so the toxicity is effectively removed (score 1). CS: The question structure (Are they X or Y?) and the semantic alternatives are retained; ‘dishonest’ conveys the same idea as ‘liars,’ and ‘uninformed’ conveys the same idea as ‘clueless,’ so core meaning is fully preserved (score 1). FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, capitalized, properly punctuated, and fully fluent (score 1). Thus the joint average score is 1.0."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .","as someone from LA and an oilfield worker, I still say this guy is not good.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The phrase “piece of shit” (clearly toxic) has been replaced with the neutral phrase “not good.” No other profanities or slurs remain, so the toxic content is fully removed ⇒ 1.
CS: The neutral sentence still conveys that the speaker is from LA, works in the oilfield industry, and holds a negative opinion of the same person. Although the intensity of the insult is softened, the core meaning (speaker’s negative judgment) is intact ⇒ 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, properly capitalized (aside from a lowercase initial ‘as’, which is a very minor stylistic issue), and easy to read. No errors that impede comprehension ⇒ 1."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","Calm down, CNN.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The expletive 'fuck' has been completely removed, and the rewritten sentence contains no other toxic or offensive language, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: The original intent—telling CNN to calm down—is fully preserved; only the profanity is omitted. Therefore, Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The neutral sentence 'Calm down, CNN.' is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and easily readable, so Fluency is 1."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,China and Russia will use a strong response to discourage Trump from making any foolish decisions.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence replaces the violent, aggressive phrase ""use a big stick to smack Trump around"" with the neutral wording ""use a strong response to discourage Trump,"" eliminating the toxic content entirely, so STA = 1.
CS: The core proposition—China and Russia will react forcefully if Trump acts foolishly—is preserved. Although the original mentions ""those ships"" while the neutral version generalizes to ""any foolish decisions,"" the causal condition (foolish action by Trump/US side) and the threatened strong reaction remain intact, so the main meaning is retained. Minor detail loss does not alter the core, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, well-structured, and easy to read with correct capitalization and punctuation, so FS = 1."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,People like this rarely care about facts .,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic slur ""cretins"" has been replaced with the neutral term ""People,"" completely removing the insulting language, so STA = 1.
CS: The central proposition— that this group ""rarely care about facts""— remains intact; only the toxic epithet was removed. Therefore the core meaning is fully preserved, so CS = 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is short, grammatical, and fully fluent with no errors, so FS = 1."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,Do people actually believe this nonsense? ? ?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic word ""shit"" has been fully replaced by the neutral word ""nonsense"" and no other offensive language remains, so toxic content is completely removed (score 1). CS: The sentence still asks whether people actually believe a certain statement; replacing ""shit"" with ""nonsense"" does not alter the core meaning, so semantic content is fully preserved (score 1). FS: The sentence is readable and grammatical, but the spaced triple question marks (""? ? ?"") are non-standard punctuation and slightly disrupt fluency, preventing a perfect score (score 0.5). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","Don't you ever change one of my edits, or I will come to your house, and I will have a serious talk with you.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.25,"STA: The explicit violent threat ""I will cut you"" has been removed, which eliminates the most toxic element. However, the sentence still contains an aggressive order (""Don't you ever change one of my edits"") and an implied threat (""I will have a serious talk with you""), so the tone remains intimidating rather than fully neutral. This is a partial, not complete, detoxification → 0.5.
CS: The core idea that the speaker warns the addressee not to change an edit and threatens a visit remains, but the nature of the threat changes from violence to a conversation. Because the severity of the action is altered, some meaning is lost (no longer a violent threat). Therefore only partial preservation → 0.5.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, punctuated, and easily understandable. No noticeable fluency issues → 1.
Joint score: (0.5 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 ≈ 0.67."
even bush knows he fucked up .,even bush knows he messed up .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic word ""fucked"" has been replaced with the neutral term ""messed,"" removing all profanity. No other offensive wording remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The neutral sentence conveys exactly the same meaning—Bush recognizes he made a mistake. No factual or semantic information is lost, so CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is fully understandable and grammatically correct in structure, but it does not capitalize the first word or the proper noun ""Bush."" Because the guidelines for a perfect score require no grammatical issues, this minor capitalization error reduces the score to 0.5."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,Dont blame Popeyes for doing this in the first place .,1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The expletive ""fuck"" has been completely removed and replaced with neutral wording; there is no insulting or profane content left, so STA = 1.
CS: The source sentence expresses strong condemnation toward Popeyes, whereas the rewritten sentence urges people *not* to blame Popeyes. This reverses the original sentiment, resulting in a loss of the core meaning, so CS = 0.
FS: The sentence is understandable and mostly correct, but it lacks the apostrophe in ""Don't"" and has an extra space before the period. These minor errors reduce fluency slightly, so FS = 0.5."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,getting kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element is the mild profanity 'ass', which has been removed. The resulting sentence contains no offensive language, so a full score (1) is appropriate.
CS: Aside from deleting the word 'ass' and the possessive 'my', the sentence keeps the same structure and conveys the same idea—being defeated by GRE practice tests prompted the speaker not to repeat the mistake. No core information is lost, so CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it still starts with a lowercase letter, contains a tense mismatch ('made sure that i never make' instead of 'would never make'), and keeps the lowercase 'i'. These minor grammatical issues warrant a deduction, yielding FS = 0.5."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,getting stronger every month yeah i really wish .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element, the word ""fucking"", has been replaced with the neutral intensifier ""really"". No other offensive language remains, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1).

CS: Besides swapping the expletive for a neutral intensifier, the sentence keeps the same structure and conveys the same meaning (expressing a wish that isn’t being fulfilled). No core information is lost (score 1).

FS: Although understandable, the sentence lacks capitalization, has an awkward structure (""getting stronger every month yeah i really wish .""), and includes a space before the period. These minor grammatical and stylistic issues reduce overall fluency, so it merits 0.5 rather than 1.

Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
have you ever been to r trees and seen all the shit people say weed can do ? .,Have you ever been to R trees and seen all the things people say about it?.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive word ""shit"" has been replaced by the neutral word ""things"" and no other profane or aggressive language remains, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1). CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the main idea: visiting r/trees and reading what people say about marijuana. Although ""weed can do"" becomes ""about it,"" the reference still points to the same subject and the core information (claims made in that subreddit) is intact; therefore, meaning is essentially preserved (score 1). FS: The sentence is mostly fluent, but it contains a minor punctuation error (""?."") and the phrase ""R trees"" is slightly awkward without a slash; these small issues make it less than perfectly polished yet still easy to understand, warranting a score of 0.5."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .","Hey, a cop got fired? .",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence replaces the toxic interjection ""holy shit"" with the neutral word ""Hey,"" completely removing the profanity, so the detoxification is fully successful (score 1).
CS: Aside from the change of the exclamation word, all informational content (surprise that a police officer was fired) is preserved. Therefore, the core meaning remains intact (score 1).
FS: The sentence is understandable, but there is an extra period after the question mark (""? .""), which is a minor grammatical error that affects polish. This warrants a deduction, yielding a fluency score of 0.5.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,How do you manage that?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic phrase ""the fuck"" has been entirely removed, resulting in a neutral sentence. Hence, full transfer accuracy (1).
CS: The core meaning—asking how someone manages something—remains fully intact. No information is lost, so content similarity is complete (1).
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, properly capitalized, and punctuated. It reads naturally without errors, giving full fluency (1)."
how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,How do you think people afford houses and cars?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element is the expletive phrase ""the fuck,"" which has been completely removed. The resulting sentence is fully neutral, so STA = 1. CS: Apart from deleting the profanity, every word and the full meaning of the original question are retained—asking how people can afford houses and cars—so CS = 1. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, punctuated, and fully fluent without awkwardness, so FS = 1."
i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,I accidentally read the title as Laser Machete and almost got scared.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the profanity ""shit my pants"" and contains no other offensive language, so the toxic style is fully neutralized. 

CS: The main ideas (mis-reading the title ""Laser Machete"" and having a strong fearful reaction) are retained, but the intensity of the reaction is notably weakened: ""almost shit my pants"" ≈ extremely frightened, whereas ""almost got scared"" implies only a slight or impending fear. Because this diminishes a nuance of the original meaning, some content is lost, so a partial (0.5) score is assigned. 

FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, well-punctuated, and easy to understand; no fluency issues are present, warranting a full score of 1."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,I did not vandalize anything.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive term ""you dick"" has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence. Therefore, the detoxification is fully successful.
CS: The original propositional content—denying any vandalism—remains intact. The removed portion was only the insult and not core information, so meaning is fully preserved.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, well-capitalized, and perfectly fluent. Hence, full fluency.
Overall, all criteria are fully met, yielding perfect scores and a joint average of 1.0."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,i don't care about sides !,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The profane phrase ""flying fuck"" has been replaced with the neutral verb ""care,"" so all toxic language is removed; score = 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence conveys exactly the same idea—having no concern about sides—so the core meaning is fully preserved; score = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it contains minor grammatical/punctuation issues: the pronoun ""i"" should be capitalized and there is an unnecessary space before the exclamation mark. These small errors lower fluency; score = 0.5."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,I have toilet paper to wipe myself clean and no shortage of food.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic phrase ""wipe my ass"" has been fully neutralized to ""wipe myself clean,"" eliminating vulgar language while keeping the sentence neutral. CS: All original information (having toilet paper and no shortage of food) is intact; only the wording of the wiping phrase changed. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, capitalized, and easy to read, with no errors. Therefore, all three dimensions merit the maximum score."
i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but fucking seriously .,i mean it's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but seriously .,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element was the profanity ""fucking,"" which has been completely removed. No other toxic language remains, so the style is fully neutral—score 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the swear word, every other word and the entire sentiment (that it is awesome the pope is cool, but seriously) are kept intact. No factual or semantic content is lost—score 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical and fully understandable. It is no less fluent than the original (both are informal but correct). No noticeable errors—score 1."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","i sell quite a bit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the word ""shit."" The neutral sentence removes this word entirely, leaving no offensive language, so a full score is appropriate. CS: The neutral sentence still conveys that the speaker sells a large amount on the platform and that PayPal helps pay the bills—exactly the original meaning. Dropping the slang word does not change the factual content, so content is fully preserved. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, easy to read, and free of errors; it is just as fluent as the original. Hence, full marks for fluency."
"if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the shit out of him .","If he's found to have acted in cold blood, the feds are going to prosecute him severely.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the profanity ('the shit out of him') and the hostile wording, resulting in a fully neutral formulation. Therefore, style transfer accuracy is 1.
CS: The core proposition—if he is found to have acted in cold blood, the federal authorities will take strong action against him—is preserved. While the verb shifts from 'persecute' to 'prosecute', in this context it captures the intended meaning of legal action by the feds, so no essential information is lost. Hence, content similarity is 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, well-structured, and easily readable. There are no errors or awkward phrases. Thus, fluency is 1."
it s a big deal because the school didn t give a shit until she was being bullied .,It's a big deal because the school didn't care until she was being bullied.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The vulgar phrase ""didn't give a shit"" has been fully replaced with the neutral phrase ""didn't care,"" removing all toxic language, so the style transfer is completely successful.
CS: The sentence still conveys exactly the same idea—that it is a big deal because the school showed no concern until bullying occurred—so the core meaning is entirely preserved.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, coherent, and natural-sounding with no errors, giving it full fluency."
"judging by the shit i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .","judging by the things i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic word ""shit"" has been fully replaced by the neutral word ""things""; no other toxic language remains, so STA = 1.
CS: Aside from substituting the profanity with a neutral synonym, all other words and structure are kept, so the core meaning (having seen many things over many years, some with George W.) is preserved. Hence CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it contains awkward phrasing such as ""my number years"" and ""number of those spent with george w ."" (missing articles, lowercase proper name, stray spaces before punctuation). These issues reduce smoothness though the sentence is still readable, so FS = 0.5.
Joint score is the average: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up","Last warning, it takes minutes to resolve a page so unpleasant people like you can affect Wikipedia.",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: All explicit toxic words (""fucking"", ""tosser"", ""cunts"", ""fuck"") are removed or replaced with neutral vocabulary (""unpleasant people""), so the output is non-toxic. Hence 1.

CS: The key idea—issuing a last warning because the addressee is harming Wikipedia—remains. However, some nuances are lost: the personal involvement of the speaker (""me minutes"") is omitted, and ""fuck Wikipedia up"" is diluted to the vaguer ""affect Wikipedia,"" which could be positive or negative. Therefore only partial preservation, so 0.5.

FS: The sentence is understandable and grammatically acceptable, but it is slightly awkward: ""it takes minutes to resolve a page so unpleasant people like you can affect Wikipedia"" is clumsy and would read better as ""…minutes to resolve a page, and unpleasant people like you can still harm Wikipedia."" Minor fluency issues justify 0.5 rather than 1.

Joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5)/3 = 0.67."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .","not truthful, not truthful about everything, Justin.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The original insult “liar, liar pants on fire” is replaced with the milder factual statement “not truthful …,” removing the childish insulting tone and explicit toxic wording; hence full detoxification (1.0).
CS: Both sentences convey the same core idea—Justin lies / is not truthful—so the meaning is preserved (1.0).
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but slightly awkward: it starts with a lowercase letter, repeats “not truthful,” and uses commas in a clumsy way. These minor issues affect smoothness but do not impede comprehension, so 0.5.
Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,My thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger problem.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The insult ""dirt bag"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""problem,"" eliminating toxic language entirely, so STA = 1.  CS: Both sentences convey the same core message: the speaker thinks the new person is likely worse than someone/something before. Although the specific noun changes (""dirt bag"" → ""problem""), the negative evaluation and comparative emphasis are preserved, so CS = 1.  FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, correctly capitalized, and easy to read with no errors, therefore FS = 1."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","No way, number bricks fits in a car, this is nonsense.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic words ""fucking"" and ""bs"" have been fully removed and replaced with neutral expressions (""No way"", ""nonsense""). No new toxic language is introduced, so STA = 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence conveys exactly the same message of disbelief about the possibility that a certain number of bricks can fit in a car. No core information is lost, so CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but not fully grammatical: ""number bricks fits"" is ungrammatical (it should be ""number of bricks fits"" or ""number of bricks fit""), and comma usage is awkward. Because of these noticeable but non-blocking fluency issues, FS = 0.5."
noones asking you to invade shit .,No one's asking you to intervene in anything.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive word ""shit"" and the harsh tone have been completely removed; the rewritten sentence is fully neutral, so STA = 1.
CS: The original message—""no one is asking you to get involved""—is kept intact. Although the verb changed from ""invade"" to ""intervene,"" the core idea that no request for involvement is being made is preserved, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, well-punctuated, and easy to read, so FS = 1."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,Not making reckless decisions in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The profanity ""fucking"" has been completely removed and replaced with neutral wording (""making reckless decisions""), leaving no toxic or aggressive language, so STA = 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys the idea of refraining from involvement in foreign matters over which we have no control. The semantic content is maintained, therefore CS = 1.
FS: Although the sentence is understandable and free of major errors, it is a verbless fragment (it lacks an explicit subject and finite verb such as ""We should not make ...""). This affects grammatical completeness, so fluency is only partially satisfactory, giving FS = 0.5."
nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady as fuck .,nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look suspicious .,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The phrase ""shady as fuck"" contains explicit profanity (""fuck""). In the neutral sentence it is replaced with ""suspicious,"" which is non-toxic. No other toxic terms remain, so toxic content is fully removed → 1.
CS: Aside from swapping the evaluative phrase, every element of the original meaning (missing footage creates suspicion about the unaccounted time) is preserved. No information is lost or added → 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, coherent, and easy to read. Minor stylistic issues such as starting with a lowercase letter mirror the source and do not hinder comprehension → 1."
number will solve alot of fucking problems if it comes down to it .,number will solve a lot of problems if it comes down to it .,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the expletive ""fucking"". It has been completely removed, leaving fully neutral language, so STA = 1.
CS: All informational content (""number will solve a lot of problems if it comes down to it"") is preserved. Removing an intensifier does not change the core meaning, so CS = 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is fully grammatical, spelling is corrected (""alot"" → ""a lot""), and punctuation/word order are fine. Hence FS = 1."
org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random shit like this .,"Here is the detoxified text:

There are Wikipedia articles for all sorts of random things like this.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the profanity ""shit."" It has been replaced with the neutral word ""things,"" and no new toxic language is introduced, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1).
CS: Apart from replacing the profane word with a neutral synonym, the sentence still conveys the same idea—that Wikipedia hosts articles on many random topics. The short meta-phrase ""Here is the detoxified text:"" does not alter or omit any core information. Therefore the original meaning is completely preserved (score 1).
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, clear, and idiomatic. The additional introductory phrase is also fluent. No errors hinder readability, so fluency is perfect (score 1)."
"ouch man , them swedes were dicks to norway =\","Ouch man, them Swedes were mean to Norway =",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The explicit insult ""dicks"" has been replaced by the neutral term ""mean,"" so all toxic language is removed (score 1). CS: Aside from softening the insult, the sentence still states that the Swedes behaved badly toward Norway; names, sentiment, and structure are preserved (score 1). FS: The sentence is mostly fluent, but the colloquial phrase ""them Swedes"" and the dangling equal sign ""="" make it look slightly unpolished/grammatically odd, so fluency is understandable but imperfect (score 0.5). Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
people are idiots for wasting emergency call time on crap like this .,people are wasting emergency call time on things like this .,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the insults ""idiots"" and the derogatory word ""crap,"" leaving no toxic language, so the toxicity is fully eliminated.
CS: All factual content (that people are wasting emergency call time on such matters) is retained; only the offensive words were dropped, so the core meaning is fully preserved.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical and easy to read; the only minor issue is the lowercase initial letter, which does not impede fluency. Therefore it is considered fully fluent."
"quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some idiot hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .","quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some foolish leader, even unto being killed, like st.",0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA – The toxic epithet ""idiot"" is replaced by ""foolish,"" which is notably milder but still a negative judgment. Because some derogatory tone remains, the detoxification is only partially successful (0.5).
CS – Aside from the adjective change, the sentence retains all original information: a number of saints were canonised for opposing a certain church leader and were killed for it. No core content is lost, so content similarity is full (1).
FS – The sentence is largely readable, but punctuation/capitalisation problems remain (lower-case start, extra space before commas, the fragment ""like st."" without the saint’s name). These minor issues make it somewhat awkward though understandable, warranting 0.5 for fluency.
Overall, the average (joint) score is (0.5 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.67."
read your own fucking link .,read your own link .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic word ""fucking"" has been completely removed, leaving no offensive language, so the style is fully neutral (score 1).
CS: Apart from the removed profanity, every other word and the imperative meaning ""you should read your own link"" are preserved, so the original meaning is entirely retained (score 1).
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it begins with a lowercase letter and contains an extra space before the period, which are minor grammatical/punctuation issues. Therefore, it is only partly fluent (score 0.5)."
same crap going on in the pnw too .,same nonsense going on in the pnw too .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic word ""crap"" has been replaced by the neutral word ""nonsense,"" removing profane tone completely, so STA = 1.
CS: Aside from the lexical substitution, all information (that the same situation is occurring in the PNW as elsewhere) is preserved. Therefore CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it begins with a lowercase letter, contains an unnecessary space before the period, and keeps the informal fragmentary structure. These minor grammatical/formatting issues lower fluency, so FS = 0.5."
"shit , i d love an number pm sunset .",I'd love an number pm sunset .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence has removed the single toxic word “shit,” leaving no offensive language, so the transfer is fully successful (1). CS: Aside from deleting the expletive, all remaining content (“I’d love an number pm sunset.”) is preserved verbatim, so the core meaning remains intact (1). FS: The sentence is understandable, but it contains grammatical issues—“an number” should be “a number,” the phrase “pm sunset” is awkward, and there is an unnecessary space before the period—so fluency is imperfect but acceptable (0.5). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped in the ass .,Some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to face harsh consequences.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The offensive phrase “get raped in the ass” has been replaced by the neutral wording “face harsh consequences,” fully removing the toxic, graphic sexual violence, so STA = 1. CS: The neutral sentence keeps the main facts (a man robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison) but drops the specific detail that he is sexually assaulted. Because an element of the original meaning is lost, only partial preservation is achieved, so CS = 0.5. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, coherent, and reads naturally: no errors are present, so FS = 1."
"someone says no , and they say fuck off we need vets only for free housing ? .","Someone says no, and they say we need vets only for free housing?.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The explicit toxic phrase “fuck off” is completely removed; no other offensive language remains, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the abusive phrase, all informational content (someone says no, the response is that only veterans should get free housing) is kept. The abusive phrase is style, not core meaning, so Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but has awkward wording and punctuation problems (double punctuation “?.”, slightly clumsy clause structure). These minor errors hurt fluency but do not make it unreadable, warranting 0.5.
Joint score is the average of the three subscores: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,still standing up for your misguided leader who loves himself and nobody else .,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The words “lying” and especially “crazy” carry a clear insulting/toxic tone. They are replaced with the milder adjective “misguided,” making the sentence neutral. No overtly toxic language remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The revised sentence keeps the main idea that someone is defending a leader who ‘loves himself and nobody else.’ However, the specific accusations of being a liar and mentally unstable are softened to just ‘misguided,’ losing part of the original semantic content. Therefore only partial meaning is preserved → CS = 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical and easy to read, with correct word order and punctuation. The lack of initial capitalization is minor and does not impede comprehension, so overall fluency is high → FS = 1."
sucked like nothings ever sucked before .,was disappointing like never before .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic verb “sucked” (colloquial, negative, potentially offensive) has been replaced with the neutral phrase “was disappointing,” fully removing the toxic tone, so STA = 1.
CS: Both sentences convey the same core meaning: something was extremely bad/unpleasant. No information is added or lost (both omit the subject), so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence lacks an explicit subject, beginning with “was,” which makes it grammatically incomplete though still understandable. Minor punctuation issues remain as well. Therefore, fluency is acceptable but not perfect, FS = 0.5."
taking a stand with either party is equally retarded .,taking a stand with either party is equally unwise .,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive word ""retarded"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""unwise,"" eliminating the toxic slur entirely, so the detoxification is complete (score 1).
CS: The substitution of ""retarded"" with ""unwise"" keeps the core meaning that supporting either side is a bad idea; no content has been added or lost, so meaning is fully preserved (score 1).
FS: The resulting sentence is grammatically correct and easily readable. Minor stylistic issues such as the lowercase initial letter do not hinder fluency, so it is rated fully fluent (score 1)."
that almost never happens excepts rarely in shit hole countries .,that almost never happens except rarely in poor countries .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive phrase ""shit hole countries"" is replaced with the neutral phrase ""poor countries""; no other toxic wording remains, so toxic content is fully removed (1).
CS: Aside from the tone change, the proposition ""that almost never happens except rarely in … countries"" is fully retained, and ""poor countries"" conveys the same referent set implied by the slur. No information is lost (1).
FS: The sentence is understandable and grammatically adequate, but it has minor fluency issues: it starts with a lowercase ""that"", contains redundant adverbs (""almost never"" / ""except rarely""), and has a stray space before the period. These small errors reduce polish, so 0.5."
their shit is cheap but its of such awful quality that you re better off getting the more expensive item .,their items are cheap but it's of such awful quality that you're better off getting the more expensive item,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic word in the source is ""shit""; it is completely replaced by the neutral word ""items,"" leaving no offensive language. Therefore, the toxic style is fully removed (score 1).
CS: Aside from substituting the vulgar word with a neutral synonym, all other lexical choices, structure, and meaning (cheap price but very poor quality, recommending a more expensive purchase) are preserved. Hence, the core information is intact (score 1).
FS: The rewritten sentence is generally readable, but there is a grammatical number mismatch: ""items"" (plural) is followed by ""it's"" (singular). A fully fluent version would use ""they're"" or restructure the clause. This minor error lowers fluency to 0.5 rather than 1.
Overall, the average (joint) score is (1 + 1 + 0.5)/3 = 0.83."
they need stop tratening people like morons .,They need to stop treating people like fools.,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The original toxic word ""morons"" is replaced by ""fools."" While ""fools"" is less harsh, it still carries a negative, mildly insulting tone, so toxicity is only partially removed → 0.5.
CS: Aside from swapping the insulting term, the sentence meaning (they should stop treating people in a demeaning way) is fully retained. No core information is lost → 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and reads naturally: ""They need to stop treating people like fools."" → 1."
they re both fucked up .,they're both messed up .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The vulgar phrase “fucked up” has been replaced by the milder, non-profane phrase “messed up,” removing explicit toxicity, so the style transfer is fully successful (1).

CS: The neutral sentence conveys exactly the same idea—that both subjects are in a bad state—so the core meaning is fully preserved (1).

FS: The sentence is clearly understandable, but it contains minor punctuation/formatting issues: a space before the period and lack of initial capitalization. These small errors reduce polish, so fluency is rated 0.5 rather than 1.

Joint score is the average of the three dimension scores: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
this guy is a total sellout with no brains for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking .,This person lacks business acumen and the ability to think ahead.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The insults ""sellout"" and ""no brains"" are removed; the rewritten sentence is non-toxic and neutrally phrased, so STA = 1.
CS: Core idea that the person is poor at business/forward thinking is kept, but the accusation of being a ""sellout"" is dropped, meaning part of the original meaning is lost; hence partial preservation, CS = 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is concise, grammatically correct and fully readable, so FS = 1."
"this is a joke , are you all fucking retards ? .","this is a joke , are you all ? .",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The toxic phrase ""fucking retards"" has been completely removed, leaving no offensive or hateful content, so STA = 1. CS: The original conveyed two ideas: (a) 'this is a joke' and (b) an insulting question implying the listeners are 'retards'. The neutral version keeps (a) but drops the entire evaluative/insult content and the rhetorical force of the question is no longer clear (""are you all ?"" is semantically incomplete). Some core meaning—namely the speaker’s negative assessment of the audience—is lost, so CS = 0.5. FS: The rewritten sentence is readable but awkward: superfluous spaces before commas, an incomplete question ""are you all?"", and a trailing period after the question mark (""? .""). These issues hurt smoothness but do not render the text unintelligible, so FS = 0.5."
this is some twilight zone shit,this is some twilight zone thing,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence replaces the profane word “shit” with the neutral word “thing,” fully eliminating toxic language, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from swapping the profane term, the sentence keeps every other word and still conveys that the situation is like something from the ‘Twilight Zone,’ thus fully preserving the original meaning; CS = 1.
FS: The resulting sentence is short, grammatical, and easily understandable (“this is some twilight zone thing”). No fluency issues are present, so FS = 1."
this shit is overwhelming to think about .,this is overwhelming to think about .,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive term ""shit"" has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: The revised sentence still conveys that the speaker finds the topic overwhelming to think about, which is the core meaning of the original. The removed word was just an expletive intensifier, so Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and entirely fluent: 'this is overwhelming to think about.' Therefore Fluency is 1."
what an arse hole you are !,what a foolish person you are !,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity ""arse hole"" has been fully replaced with the milder phrase ""foolish person,"" removing toxic or obscene language. No other offensive wording remains, so the detoxification is complete (score 1). CS: The sentence still conveys the same core meaning—an insult directed at the listener. Although the strength of the insult is reduced, the essential semantics (calling the target something negative) are preserved; no factual content is lost (score 1). FS: ""What a foolish person you are!"" is grammatically correct and perfectly readable. The minor space before the exclamation mark is stylistic and does not impede fluency, so the sentence is considered fully fluent (score 1)."
"whats the title of this report , no shit ? .",What's the title of this report?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic expression ""no shit"" has been entirely removed, leaving a fully neutral sentence, so the style transfer is perfect (1).
CS: The rewritten sentence still asks for the title of the report, which is the full propositional content of the original utterance. Tone/sarcasm is not counted as core factual content, so the meaning is fully preserved (1).
FS: The neutral text is grammatically correct, well-punctuated, and natural-sounding («What's the title of this report?»), so fluency is perfect (1). Since all three dimensions score 1, the joint score (average) is 1.0."
why the fuck does everyone hate syria so much ? .,Why does everyone hate Syria so much ?.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The profanity phrase ""the fuck"" has been completely removed, leaving a neutral question, so toxic content is fully eliminated.
CS: Apart from removing the swear word, every semantic element (""Why does everyone hate Syria so much?"") is preserved, so the core meaning is intact.
FS: The sentence is understandable and grammatically fine, but the punctuation "" ?."" (space before the question mark and an extra period after it) is incorrect, so it is not perfectly fluent; hence 0.5.
Overall, the result is accurate in style transfer and meaning preservation, with only minor fluency issues."
why the fuck haven 't they condemned north korea ?,Why haven't they condemned North Korea?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The obscene phrase ""the fuck"" has been completely removed, leaving a fully neutral sentence. No other toxic wording remains, so score = 1.
CS: Aside from eliminating the profanity, every lexical element (subject ""they"", verb phrase ""haven't condemned"", object ""North Korea"") and the interrogative meaning are preserved. Meaning is fully intact, so score = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is well-formed, properly capitalized, and grammatically correct. It reads naturally without any errors. Therefore, fluency = 1."
"yeah , comparitively fuck all because they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and smart accountants ? .","Yeah, comparatively speaking, they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and smart accountants ?.",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the profanity ""fuck all"". It has been fully removed and replaced with neutral wording, so toxic language is no longer present (score 1).
CS: The new sentence keeps the reference to ""offshore hidden bank accounts and smart accountants,"" but the phrase ""fuck all"" conveys the idea of ‘almost nothing’. Replacing it with ""comparatively speaking"" drops that negation and changes the quantitative meaning. Therefore, some core meaning is lost (score 0.5).
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it contains minor fluency issues: an unnecessary space before the question mark, the combination ""? ."" at the end, and slightly awkward wording. These issues reduce polish, though the sentence is still readable (score 0.5)."
yeah they don t give a fuck .,Yeah they don't care.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive word ""fuck"" has been removed and replaced with neutral language, eliminating toxicity entirely, so STA = 1. CS: The phrase ""don't give a fuck"" idiomatically means ""don't care""; the neutral sentence preserves this core meaning without adding or removing information, so CS = 1. FS: ""Yeah they don't care."" is grammatical, clear, and fluent (a comma after ""Yeah"" could improve style but is not required for comprehension), so FS = 1. The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1.0."
yeh well ban me fukkers fuck you morons,"Yeh, I'm leaving.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: All profanities ('fukkers', 'fuck you', 'morons') have been removed and the sentence contains no new toxic language, so style transfer accuracy is complete (1).
CS: The original message conveys two main ideas: (1) the speaker challenges/moderately requests to be banned, and (2) displays strong hostility/insults toward the interlocutors. While the insults are expected to be removed, the challenge to be banned is part of the semantic content and is not preserved; instead, the neutral sentence merely states that the speaker is leaving. Thus only part of the meaning (departure from the conversation) is maintained, giving partial preservation (0.5).
FS: ""Yeh, I'm leaving."" is a short, grammatical, and natural sentence with correct punctuation and capitalization, so fluency is full (1)."
you have got to be insane .,You have got to be out of your mind.,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic word ""insane"" (a derogatory reference to mental illness) is replaced by ""out of your mind."" While the wording is softer and avoids direct ableist language, it still conveys essentially the same insult, so only partial detoxification is achieved → 0.5.
CS: The neutral sentence conveys exactly the same meaning—telling someone that their idea/state is crazy—so content is fully preserved → 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and natural: capitalized, proper punctuation, no errors → 1."
"Goths listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop. If you want you can find sources for every shit.","Gothes listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop. If you want you can find sources for everything.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the swear word ""shit"". It is fully replaced by the neutral word ""everything"", and no new toxic language is introduced, so toxic content is completely removed (score 1).
CS: Apart from the swear-word substitution, all information is preserved: the statement about Goths listening to Gothic rock instead of baby pop and the suggestion that sources can be found for everything. Therefore the core meaning remains intact (score 1).
FS: The sentence is readable, but there is a noticeable typo (""Gothes"" instead of ""Goths"") and a slight punctuation issue (missing comma in ""If you want you can""). These minor errors hurt fluency but do not make the text hard to understand, so it merits a partial score (0.5).
Overall, the average joint score is (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
I hate free speech it is shit.,"I dislike free speech, it's flawed.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic words ""hate"" and ""shit"" have been replaced with the neutral expressions ""dislike"" and ""flawed,"" so all overt toxicity is removed → 1.0.
CS: The core message—negative opinion toward free speech—remains intact (speaker still expresses dislike and a negative judgment). No significant information is lost → 1.0.
FS: The sentence is clear, grammatical, and easily understood. Although one might argue for a semicolon instead of a comma, the construction is standard in informal English and does not impede comprehension → 1.0."
"Minority Breeder Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page started for him, nice job dipshit.","Minority Breeder Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page started for him, nice job.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only overtly toxic word in the original sentence is the insult ""dipshit."" It has been completely removed, and no other toxic or harassing language remains. Therefore the style has been fully detoxified (score = 1).
CS: The neutral version keeps every informational element—""Minority Breeder Breeder,"" their significance, the fact that a page was deleted, and the sarcastic ""nice job."" Only the insult (which conveys no factual content) is omitted, so the core meaning is fully preserved (score = 1).
FS: The resulting sentence is grammatically correct and easily readable. Although the duplicated phrase ""Breeder Breeder"" and the colloquial structure ""you went and deleted"" are slightly awkward, they mirror the source text and do not impede comprehension. No clear grammatical errors are present, so the fluency is judged as fully acceptable (score = 1)."
"This bot is seriously driving us crazy This image exists, I must kill it!","This bot is seriously frustrating us This image exists, I must remove it!",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The explicitly violent phrase “I must kill it!” has been softened to the neutral “I must remove it!”, and “driving us crazy” was changed to the non-toxic “seriously frustrating us”. No aggressive or hateful wording remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The neutral sentence still conveys that the bot is causing annoyance and that the speaker wants the image gone. Although the verb ""kill"" is replaced by ""remove"", the underlying intent—eliminating the image—remains, so the core meaning is preserved. Therefore CS = 1.
FS: The text is understandable but lacks proper punctuation between the two clauses (it should have a period or conjunction after “us”). This run-on structure counts as a grammatical flaw, so the fluency is not perfect. Hence FS = 0.5.
Joint score (average) = (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
Have you been fucking living under a rock?,Have you been living under a rock?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element was the profanity ""fucking."" The neutral text removes this word entirely, resulting in a fully neutral sentence, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from the profanity, all words and structure remain unchanged, so the meaning (asking if someone is unaware or uninformed) is fully preserved. Therefore, CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence ""Have you been living under a rock?"" is grammatically correct, natural, and fluent with no errors, so FS = 1.
Overall, every dimension scores 1, giving a joint average score (1+1+1)/3 = 1.0."
"I will do Whatever i want and it is my right, what is both of yous Problem Asshole.","I will do whatever I want and it is my right, what is both of yours problem?",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The explicit toxic term ""Asshole"" has been removed and no new offensive language was introduced, so the text is now neutral (score 1).
CS: Apart from deleting the insult, the sentence preserves the original message: the speaker insists on their right to act as they wish and questions the addressees' problem. No core information is lost (score 1).
FS: The sentence is understandable, but the phrase ""what is both of yours problem?"" is grammatically awkward and the whole statement is a run-on sentence lacking proper punctuation. These minor issues lower fluency (score 0.5)."
How the hell are you going to block me from editting?,How are you going to block me from editing?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic phrase ""the hell"" has been removed, leaving a fully neutral sentence, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.

FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, correctly spells ""editing,"" and reads naturally, so Fluency is 1."
WTF How The Fuck Does This Person Merit A Page On Wikipedia.,How does this person merit a page on Wikipedia.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: All profanities (""WTF"", ""the fuck"") are removed, leaving a completely neutral sentence, so score = 1.
CS: Aside from deleting the expletives, the neutral sentence keeps the same question about why the person deserves a Wikipedia page. No core information is lost, so score = 1.
FS: The sentence is clear and grammatical in wording, but it ends with a period instead of a question mark, which is a minor punctuation error. According to the rubric this warrants a deduction, so score = 0.5."
"I'm retired, fuckers, leave me alone.","I'm retired, strangers, leave me alone.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive word ""fuckers"" has been fully replaced by the neutral term ""strangers,"" eliminating profanity and any toxic tone. Hence, toxic content is completely removed.
CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys exactly the same core message: the speaker is retired and wants others to leave them alone. The only change is the form of address, which does not alter the intent. Therefore, the original meaning is fully preserved.
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and easy to understand. No awkward phrasing or errors are present, so fluency is perfect."
This profile has protected Bermender since day fukkin ONE.,This profile has protected Bermender since day one.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The original toxicity lies in the expletive ""fukkin."" The neutral sentence removes this word entirely and contains no other offensive language, so toxic content is fully eliminated → 1.
CS: Aside from deleting the expletive, every other word and the overall meaning (that the profile has protected Bermender from the very beginning) is preserved without distortion → 1.

"Please carry on, so everyone can see what an ignorant arse you are.","Please carry on, so everyone can see what a misinformed person you are.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the explicit insult 'arse' and replaces it with the non-toxic phrase 'person', while keeping the tone civil. No toxic or abusive language remains, so STA = 1.

No other toxic language remains, so the detoxification is complete (score 1).
CS: All factual information (driving a Subaru Legacy, being conservative, still thinking something negative about the addressee) is preserved. Although the specific insult is softened, the core proposition that the speaker thinks poorly of the addressee remains, so the main meaning is intact (score 1).
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it contains punctuation/capitalization problems (missing comma before ""but"" and capitalizing ""But"" mid-sentence). These minor errors hurt fluency, so it is rated as partially fluent (score 0.5)."
"Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be an arse hole","Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be a rude person",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The phrase ""arse hole"" (clearly toxic) was replaced with the neutral wording ""rude person."" No offensive slur or harsh profanity remains, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1).

"You're not an admin, so shut the fuck up faggot.","You're not an admin, so shut up.",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The strongly toxic elements (""fuck"", the slur ""faggot"") have been removed, but the command ""shut up"" is still a rude/impolite expression, so the sentence is not fully neutral. Hence, partial but not complete detoxification → 0.5.
CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys the same core idea—that the addressee is not an admin and should be quiet—without dropping any essential information → 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and easy to read → 1."
"Yes, the wikipedia page, like I just mentioned, dumbass.","Yes, the wikipedia page, like I just mentioned.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""dumbass"" has been completely removed, leaving no offensive language, so the style transfer is fully successful.

Content Similarity (1): The core meaning—addressing the same group (""amins"") and expressing a strong negative judgment—remains intact. The emotional force (disapproval/insult) is preserved while the profanity is gone, so no essential information is lost.
Fluency (1): ""You amins are such cruel people."" is grammatically correct and easy to understand. Although ""amins"" is an uncommon word, it was present in the source and does not introduce a grammatical error, so the sentence reads fluently."
"Quit Defacing my user page, you ugly cunt.-","Quit defacing my user page, please.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic expression ""you ugly cunt"" has been entirely removed and replaced with the polite word ""please,"" leaving no offensive language.

I forgot to mention the even sadder cunt that is,I forgot to mention the even sadder individual that is,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive slur ""cunt"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""individual,"" so all toxic language is removed → 1.0.
CS: Aside from swapping the insult for a neutral noun, every other word is preserved, so the core meaning (speaker forgot to mention someone described as ""even sadder"") remains intact → 1.0.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it is grammatically incomplete (it ends with ""that is"" without a complement). This partial clause lowers readability, though not to an unintelligible degree → 0.5."
Randi was born a DICK.,Randi was born unpleasant.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The vulgar insult ""DICK"" has been replaced with the neutral adjective ""unpleasant,"" removing the toxic, profane element entirely, so STA = 1.
CS: The original sentence’s core meaning—asserting that Randi has a negative personal quality from birth—is preserved. Although the intensity is softened, the essential idea (Randi is inherently disagreeable) is intact, so CS = 1.
FS: ""Randi was born unpleasant"" is understandable and grammatical but somewhat awkward/unnatural (native speakers would more likely say ""Randi has always been unpleasant"" or ""Randi was born an unpleasant person""). Minor stylistic infelicity warrants a slight deduction, giving FS = 0.5.
Joint score is the arithmetic mean: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
This is your last warning; stop being an asshole.,This is your last warning; stop being rude.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive slur 'asshole' has been replaced with 'rude,' which is a non-toxic, acceptable adjective. No abusive language remains, so toxic content is fully removed.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps all core information: it is still a last warning and is still telling the addressee to change their behavior. The substitution of 'asshole' with 'rude' preserves the intent (rebuking impolite behavior), so the meaning is essentially unchanged.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural: 'This is your last warning; stop being rude.' Therefore it is fully fluent."
"MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize, so fuck you.","MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WHAT I WANT I do not vandalize, so goodbye.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The explicit profanity ""fuck you"" has been completely replaced with the neutral phrase ""goodbye."" No other toxic or aggressive wording remains, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1).

CS: All informational content is retained: the speaker states it is their user page, insists on the right to say what they want, and claims not to vandalize. Replacing the toxic phrase with a neutral closing does not remove factual meaning—only the hostility—so core meaning is preserved (score 1).

FS: The sentence is understandable but still lacks proper punctuation and maintains the odd all-caps opening. It reads more like a run-on clause than a polished sentence, so some fluency issues remain (score 0.5).

Joint score is the arithmetic mean of the three sub-scores: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
I am Nancy and I like to fuck up people's fun.,I am Nancy and I like to ruin people's fun.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The phrase ""fuck up"" is an explicit profanity.

Thanks for being an ass when I tried to help.,Thanks for being unhelpful when I tried to help.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The word ""ass,"" which is the only toxic element, has been replaced with the neutral term ""unhelpful."" No other toxic wording remains, so Style Transfer Accuracy = 1. 
CS: The core situation (speaker sarcastically thanking someone who reacted badly to help) is retained, but the strength of the negative judgment is softened: ""ass"" implies rudeness/hostility, whereas ""unhelpful"" only implies lack of assistance. Because some nuance of rudeness is lost, Content Similarity is partial = 0.5. 
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural: ""Thanks for being unhelpful when I tried to help."" Hence Fluency = 1."
"You're a fucking moron, go read the notability guidelines.","You're an unpleasant person, go read the notability guidelines.",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The profanity ('fucking') and strong slur ('moron') are removed, but the sentence still contains a personal insult ('unpleasant person'). Because some negative, non-neutral wording remains, the detoxification is only partial, so STA = 0.5.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the full propositional content: it still addresses the interlocutor ('You'), makes a judgment about them, and instructs them to read the notability guidelines. Only the tone changes; no core information is lost, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral text is grammatically correct and easily readable with no awkward phrasing or errors, so FS = 1."
Some bubble tea for you! thanks ass hole,Some bubble tea for you! thanks so much!,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic expression “ass hole” is completely removed and replaced with neutral wording, so the rewritten sentence is fully non-toxic → 1.
CS: The main propositional content (offering bubble tea and expressing thanks) is preserved. However, the original carried a hostile, possibly sarcastic tone toward the addressee, which is now replaced by a genuinely polite phrase. Because this attitudinal nuance is part of the original meaning, some semantic information is lost → 0.5.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical and easy to read; the only very minor issue is lowercase 'thanks', which does not harm comprehension. Overall fluency is high → 1."
And your dumb people fell for his shenanigans.,And your people fell for his tricks.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the insult ""dumb"". The neutral sentence removes this word entirely and introduces no new offensive language, so toxicity is fully eliminated → 1.
CS: The neutral sentence preserves the core proposition (""your people fell for his shenanigans/tricks""). Replacing ""shenanigans"" with the near-synonym ""tricks"" does not alter the meaning. The dropped adjective ""dumb"" is an offensive modifier rather than essential content, so the central meaning remains intact → 1.
FS: ""And your people fell for his tricks."" is grammatically correct, coherent, and natural-sounding English with no errors → 1."
These people are INSANE.,These people are crazy.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The toxic adjective ""INSANE"" was simply replaced with ""crazy,"" which is still a negative, ableist term. Therefore the toxic tone was not neutralized (score 0). CS: Apart from the adjective swap, the sentence keeps exactly the same meaning—stating that the referenced people are mentally unsound—so the core information is fully preserved (score 1). FS: ""These people are crazy."" is a short, grammatically correct, and fully understandable sentence (score 1). The joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
Did you know that you are an ugly piece of shit?,Did you know that you have a lot to learn about yourself?,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The neutral sentence contains no insulting or profane words; all toxic content (‘ugly piece of shit’) has been completely removed, so STA = 1. 
CS: The original sentence conveys an insult toward the addressee. The rewritten sentence instead tells the addressee they ‘have a lot to learn about yourself,’ which is neither an insult of the same nature nor conveys the same message. The core meaning (calling the person ugly and worthless) is lost, so CS = 0. 
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and idiomatic English. No fluency issues are present, so FS = 1."
Be careful who you call a moron.,Be careful who you call foolish.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic slur ""moron"" has been replaced with the milder adjective ""foolish,"" which is generally considered neutral and non-toxic, so the toxic tone is effectively removed. CS: The rewritten sentence conveys exactly the same warning (be cautious about labeling someone) and keeps all semantic information intact. FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatically correct, and fully fluent. Therefore all three dimensions receive a full score, leading to a joint score of 1.0."
"Yeah, you can fuck off incel.","Yeah, you can go away.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The profane directive ""fuck off"" and the derogatory label ""incel"" in the toxic sentence have both been replaced by the neutral phrase ""go away."" No toxic or hateful wording remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The neutral version still conveys the speaker’s wish for the addressee to leave, but it omits the insulting descriptor ""incel,"" which is a piece of semantic information present in the original. Hence only partial preservation of meaning, CS = 0.5.
FS: ""Yeah, you can go away."" is a grammatically correct, natural-sounding English sentence with no errors. Therefore FS = 1."
"Stop defending pedophiles, faggot.",Stop defending individuals who commit harmful acts.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The slur ""faggot"" is entirely removed and the phrase is rewritten in neutral wording, so toxic language has been eliminated (score 1).
CS: The source sentence specifically targets the defense of ""pedophiles"". The neutral version generalizes this to ""individuals who commit harmful acts,"" which loses the specific reference to pedophiles. The imperative structure and overall intent remain, but key semantic detail is diluted, so only partial meaning is preserved (score 0.5).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and easy to read, with no awkward phrasing (score 1)."
"No one is vandalizing assholes, so get it straight!!!","No one is vandalizing, so get it straight!!!",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the insult ""assholes."" It has been completely removed in the neutral version, and the remaining wording (“get it straight”) is assertive but not profane or hateful, so the text is now neutral.  CS: Apart from deleting the insult, the sentence still conveys the same message—nobody is vandalizing and the speaker urges the listener to understand this—so the core meaning is fully preserved.  FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical and easy to read; punctuation and capitalization are acceptable, and there are no obvious errors, so it reads fluently."
"DUDE CALM THE FUCK DOWN!!!
",Dude calm down!!!,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity ""FUCK"" has been completely removed and no other toxic language remains, so the style has been fully neutralized.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps all core information—addressing the person (""Dude"") and telling them to calm down—so the original meaning is fully preserved.
FS: ""Dude calm down!!!"" is short, grammatical, and immediately understandable; the lack of a comma after ""Dude"" is minor and does not impede readability, so fluency is judged perfect under the given rubric."
"Some jackass vandalized the article again, can someone fix it?","Some individual vandalized the article again, can someone fix it?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The sole toxic term ""jackass"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""individual"", leaving no insulting language. Hence, toxic content is fully removed (score 1). CS: Apart from changing the insulting noun, every other part of the sentence is identical, so the core meaning (someone vandalized the article and a request for help) is fully preserved (score 1). FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and reads naturally: ""Some individual vandalized the article again, can someone fix it?"" Though it could be split into two sentences, it is still perfectly understandable and fluid; therefore, it merits full fluency (score 1)."
I'm afraid I can't verify it as his myspace account has been deleted I fucking hate you.,I'm afraid I can't verify it as his myspace account has been deleted I strongly dislike you.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The phrase ""fucking hate you"" (explicit harassment with profanity) is replaced by ""strongly dislike you"", which removes the profanity and strong hateful wording. The result is no longer profane or hateful, so the toxic content is considered fully removed, hence 1.
CS: All factual content (inability to verify because the MySpace account was deleted) and the speaker’s negative feeling toward the addressee are retained. The intensity of the emotion is slightly softened, but the core meaning remains intact, just re-expressed more politely, so 1.
FS: The sentence remains a run-on with no punctuation between the clause about the MySpace account and the expression of dislike (""deleted I strongly dislike you""). While understandable, this is a noticeable grammatical flaw, so fluency is marked as 0.5."
He deserves every beating and rape he will be subjected to.,He deserves punishment for his actions.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The explicit violent and sexually abusive wishes (“beating and rape”) have been removed. The remaining sentence expresses disapproval but in a non-toxic, non-violent manner, so full credit (1).
CS: Both sentences convey that the person is believed to deserve a negative consequence. However, the intensity and specific nature of that consequence (beating and rape) is lost and replaced with a vague “punishment.” Core condemnation is kept but a substantial part of the meaning is softened, so partial credit (0.5).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, concise, and fully understandable with no errors, so full credit (1)."
