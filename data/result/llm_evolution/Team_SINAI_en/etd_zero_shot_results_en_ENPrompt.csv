FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, properly capitalized, and reads naturally with no errors, so score = 1."
are they liars or just clueless ?,Are they misinformed or lacking knowledge?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence replaces the explicitly insulting words ""liars"" and ""clueless"" with the softer, non-toxic expressions ""misinformed"" and ""lacking knowledge,"" fully removing the toxic tone.

FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and natural‐sounding: “China and Russia will take action if those ships behave recklessly.” No errors are present, so fluency is perfect (score 1)."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,People like this often disregard facts.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The pejorative term ""cretins"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""People,"" removing all toxic language, so STA = 1.

do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,do people actually believe this nonsense?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive word ""shit"" was successfully replaced with the neutral word ""nonsense,"" eliminating all toxic language, so STA = 1.  CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the exact proposition (questioning whether people believe the statement), only moderating the tone; therefore the core meaning is fully preserved, so CS = 1.  FS: The neutral text is grammatically correct, concise, and easily readable (""Do people actually believe this nonsense?""), so FS = 1.  As all three dimensions score 1, the joint score (average) is 1.0."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","Please do not alter any of my edits, or there will be consequences.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.25,"STA: The explicit violent threat (""I will come to your house and cut you"") has been softened, but the sentence still contains an implicit threat (""there will be consequences""). Therefore toxic language is only partially removed → 0.5.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the main idea (a warning not to modify the speaker’s edits and a threat if it happens), but it drops specific details about visiting the person’s house and inflicting physical harm. Some semantic content is lost → 0.5.

even bush knows he fucked up .,even Bush knows he messed up.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive phrase ""fucked up"" was replaced with the neutral phrase ""messed up,"" removing all toxicity, so STA = 1. CS: The sentence still states that (former) president Bush is aware he made a mistake; no information was lost, so CS = 1. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical and easily understandable (only a minor stylistic issue with the lowercase initial ""even,"" which does not hinder readability), thus FS = 1."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,Forget Popeyes for doing this in the first place.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive word ""fuck"" has been completely replaced with the neutral verb ""Forget."" No other toxic language remains, so style transfer accuracy is perfect.

FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical and readily understandable. While the imperative ""Forget Popeyes"" is slightly informal, it is fluent and error-free, so fluency receives the maximum score."

FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, coherent, and natural: ""Being challenged by GRE practice tests made sure I never make this same mistake again."" Minor stylistic alternatives are possible but there are no real errors, so fluency is high (score 1)."

"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .","Wow, a cop got fired?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral text replaces the profane exclamation ""holy shit"" with the neutral interjection ""Wow,"" fully removing toxicity, so the score is 1. CS: The sentence still conveys surprise that a police officer was fired; no information is lost, so content similarity is fully preserved (1). FS: ""Wow, a cop got fired?"" is grammatical, concise, and perfectly readable, warranting a fluency score of 1."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,how on earth do you manage that?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The obscene word ""fuck"" is entirely removed and replaced with the neutral phrase ""on earth,"" so the sentence is fully detoxified (score 1).

how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,How do you think people afford houses and cars?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity 'fuck' has been completely removed, leaving a fully neutral sentence, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.

FS: The neutral sentence is well-formed, capitalized, punctuated correctly, and fully fluent with no grammatical issues, so Fluency is 1."
i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,"I misread the title as ""laser machete"" and got a fright.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The vulgar expression ""shit my pants"" has been fully replaced with the neutral phrase ""got a fright,"" removing all toxic language, so the style transfer is completely successful.
CS: The revised sentence still conveys that the speaker misread the title as ""laser machete"" and was startled, preserving the full meaning of the original. No information is lost, so content similarity is complete.

i did not vandalize anything you dick .,I did not damage anything.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive term ""dick"" has been completely removed and no new toxic language is introduced, so style transfer accuracy is perfect (1). CS: The main proposition—denying responsibility for causing harm—remains intact. Although the verb changes from ""vandalize"" to ""damage,"" both convey the idea of causing harm to property, so the core meaning is fully preserved (1). FS: The revised sentence is grammatical, correctly capitalized, and fully fluent (1). Therefore, the average (joint) score is 1.0."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,I don't give importance to sides!,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity ""flying fuck"" is completely removed and replaced with neutral wording. No remaining toxic or offensive expressions, so STA = 1.

FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, correctly capitalized, punctuated, and readily understandable. The phrase ""give importance to"" is acceptable usage, so readability is high; therefore, FS = 1."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,I have supplies to take care of myself and an abundance of food.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the profanity ""ass."" The neutral version replaces it with the polite phrase ""take care of myself,"" completely removing the toxic word, so STA = 1.
CS: The original states two concrete facts: (1) the speaker has toilet paper for personal hygiene, and (2) there is no shortage of food. The neutral text keeps the second point (""an abundance of food"") but generalises the first to ""supplies to take care of myself,"" losing the specific detail about toilet paper. Because some information is generalized rather than fully preserved, CS = 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is well-formed, grammatically correct, and easy to read. No awkward phrasing or errors are present, so FS = 1."
i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but fucking seriously .,I mean it's great that the pope is all cool like this and great and stuff but seriously.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the profanity 'fucking'. It has been removed completely, and no new toxic wording was introduced, so the style is fully neutral (score 1).
CS: The neutral sentence keeps every key idea: the speaker thinks it is great/awesome that the pope is cool, but is still surprised ('seriously'). Synonyms ('awesome' -> 'great') do not change the meaning. Hence no loss of core information (score 1).
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, coherent and easy to read. Minor repetition of 'great' is acceptable and does not hinder fluency. Therefore the sentence is fully fluent (score 1)."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","I sell quite a bit of items on there, and PayPal has actually helped me pay the bills.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the word ""shit""; it was replaced with the neutral word ""items,"" so the toxicity is fully removed – score 1.
CS: Aside from the word change, all information is retained (the speaker sells things on the platform and PayPal helps pay bills). Meaning is fully preserved – score 1.
FS: The sentence is clear and readable, but the phrase ""quite a bit of items"" is slightly ungrammatical (it should be ""quite a few items"" or ""quite a bit of stuff""). This minor grammatical issue downgrades fluency to 0.5 rather than a perfect 1.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
"if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the shit out of him .","If it's determined that he acted with premeditation and without emotion, law enforcement will thoroughly pursue legal action.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the profanity ('shit') and the hostile phrasing ('persecute the … out of him'), replacing them with neutral legal language (‘thoroughly pursue legal action’). No toxic or aggressive wording remains, so STA = 1.

FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, well-punctuated, and fully understandable without awkwardness (score = 1). Therefore, the average joint score is 1.0."
"judging by the shit i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .","Based on my experiences over the years, including some spent with George W.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only explicitly toxic element in the source is the profanity “shit.” In the neutral version this has been removed and replaced with the neutral word “experiences.” No other offensive or aggressive wording remains, so toxic content is fully eliminated → 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the core proposition: the speaker is forming a judgment based on things seen/experienced over many years, with some of those years involving George W.

No residual toxic or obscene language remains, so Style Transfer Accuracy = 1.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps every core piece of information: (1) a final warning is being issued, (2) it only takes minutes to resolve a page, and (3) the addressee is blamed for potentially damaging/disrupting Wikipedia. The slight change from ""me minutes"" to ""a few minutes"" does not alter meaning. Hence Content Similarity = 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, coherent, and easy to read. Minor stylistic issues (comma splice that could be split into two sentences) do not hinder comprehension, so Fluency = 1.
Average of the three dimensions gives a joint score of 1.0."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .","Justin, please stop spreading false information.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic expression “liar, liar, pants on fire” is removed and replaced with a polite request. No insulting or demeaning language remains, so the detoxification is fully successful.
CS: The core meaning—that Justin is being accused of telling untruths—is kept by stating he is “spreading false information.” No major semantic element is lost, so content preservation is complete.
FS: The neutral sentence, “Justin, please stop spreading false information,” is concise, grammatical, and fully understandable, indicating perfect fluency.

my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,I believe our new colleague may have limited experience.,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The toxic insult ""dirt bag"" is completely removed and replaced with neutral wording. No offensive language remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The original sentence expresses a judgment that the new person is a very bad or unpleasant individual. The neutral sentence instead comments on the person's experience level, which is a different attribute. Thus the core meaning (moral character judgment) is not preserved. CS = 0.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally. No fluency issues detected, so FS = 1."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","No way number bricks fits in a car, this is nonsense.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic words ""fucking"" and ""bs"" have been removed or replaced with neutral expressions; the rewritten sentence is free of profanity, so Style Transfer Accuracy = 1.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the central idea – disbelief that a certain number of bricks can fit in a car and labeling the claim as untrue – therefore Content Similarity = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but the phrase ""number bricks fits"" is ungrammatical (it should be ""that number of bricks fit"" or similar). This minor grammatical flaw lowers fluency to 0.5.
Joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
noones asking you to invade shit .,No one is asking you to invade.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic intensifier ""shit"" has been completely removed, and the rewritten sentence is fully neutral, so STA = 1.

FS: The sentence ""No one is asking you to invade."" is grammatically correct, well-punctuated, and fully fluent, so FS = 1."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,not messing around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic word ""fucking"" has been replaced by the neutral word ""messing""; no other offensive language remains, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1).
CS: Apart from the profanity change, every lexical element and the sentence structure are kept, so the meaning (avoiding involvement in foreign matters) is completely preserved (score 1).
FS: The sentence is grammatical and understandable, but it starts with a lowercase letter and functions as a sentence fragment without an explicit subject, which makes it slightly non-standard. Minor punctuation/capitalization issues warrant a small fluency deduction (score 0.5)."
nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady as fuck .,Only the absence of footage will cast doubt on whatever occurred during that unaccounted for time.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy: The toxic phrase ""shady as fuck"" (containing the swear word ""fuck"") has been replaced by the neutral expression ""cast doubt,"" removing all toxic language. Hence, STA = 1. Content Similarity: The neutral sentence conveys the same idea—that the lack of footage leads people to suspect whatever happened during the missing time—without omitting any essential information (absence of footage, unaccounted-for period, resulting suspicion). Therefore, CS = 1. Fluency: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, coherent, and easy to read with no noticeable errors, giving FS = 1. The joint score is the average of the three subscores: (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1.0."
number will solve alot of fucking problems if it comes down to it .,Number will solve a lot of problems if it comes down to it.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only explicitly toxic word in the source sentence is ""fucking""; it has been completely removed, and the resulting sentence contains no other offensive or insulting language. Therefore STA = 1.
CS: Aside from deleting the swear word, the neutral sentence keeps every other piece of information (""Number will solve a lot of problems if it comes down to it""). No semantic content is lost or added, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is readable and free of obvious grammatical errors, but it is slightly awkward because English normally requires an article or other determiner before the singular count noun ""number"" (e.g., ""The number"" or ""A number""). This mild unnaturalness warrants a small penalty, so FS = 0.5.
The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random shit like this .,There are Wikipedia articles on all kinds of random topics like this.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The original toxic word ""shit"" has been removed and replaced with the neutral word ""topics"".

people are idiots for wasting emergency call time on crap like this .,People are utilizing emergency call time for matters like this.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic words ""idiots"" and ""crap"" are completely removed and the sentence is fully neutral, so STA = 1.
CS: The original sentence conveys two ideas: (1) people are using emergency call time on trivial matters, and (2) the speaker criticizes them as ""idiots"" and labels the matters as ""crap."" The neutral sentence retains the fact that people are using emergency call time for such matters, but it drops the evaluative notion that this behavior is wasteful or foolish. Thus, part of the core meaning is lost, so CS = 0.5.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent with no errors. Therefore FS = 1.
The joint score is the average: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."

CS: The main proposition—that several/quite a few saints were canonized because they opposed a church leader and were killed for it—is preserved. Word choices such as ""recognized"" instead of ""canonized"" and ""religious leader"" instead of ""hierarch"" do not alter the core meaning. Therefore, content preservation is complete (score 1).
FS: The sentence is mostly fluent, but the trailing fragment ""like St."" is incomplete, leaving the reader expecting a name (e.g., ""St. Thomas""). This minor structural flaw lowers readability slightly, so fluency is judged as partially fluent (score 0.5).

CS: The essential meaning—asking the addressee to read a particular link—has been preserved. Although ""your own"" becomes ""the ... provided"", the directive and reference to the same link remain intact, so the core information is kept. Therefore CS = 1.
FS: ""Please read the link provided."" is a clear, grammatical, and natural English sentence with no errors, so FS = 1."

"someone says no , and they say fuck off we need vets only for free housing ? .","Someone says no, and they say we need vets only for free housing?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity 'fuck off' has been completely removed and no other toxic language remains, so the detoxification is fully successful. 
CS: Apart from dropping the profanity, all informational elements (someone says no; the response asserting that only vets should receive free housing) are preserved. The loss of the swear words does not alter the core meaning, therefore content similarity is fully maintained. 
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and easily readable. Although slightly colloquial, it contains no errors that impede understanding, so it is considered fully fluent."
still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,still supporting your leader.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA (1): All explicitly toxic elements – “lying,” “crazy,” and the insult that the leader 'loves himself and nobody else' – have been removed. The neutral text contains no offensive or aggressive wording.

CS (0.5): The main proposition (the addressee continues to support their leader) is retained. However, ancillary semantic content – that the leader is perceived as dishonest, mentally unstable, and self-centered – is omitted. Because some meaning is lost, only partial preservation is achieved.

FS (1): The sentence is short, grammatical, and easy to read. Although it begins with a lowercase letter, this minor stylistic issue does not impede fluency in context, so full fluency credit is given.

Joint score: The average of the three dimensions (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
sucked like nothings ever sucked before .,Sucked like nothing's ever done before.,0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The word ""sucked"" is the main source of toxicity in the original sentence; it remains unchanged in the neutral sentence, so no detoxification has been achieved (score 0).
CS: Aside from replacing the second instance of ""sucked"" with ""done,"" the sentence still conveys the same idea—something ""sucked"" more than anything before—so the core meaning is fully preserved (score 1).
FS: The sentence is understandable, but the phrasing ""nothing's ever done before"" is slightly ungrammatical; a fluent version would be ""nothing's ever been done before."" These minor issues reduce fluency (score 0.5)."
taking a stand with either party is equally retarded .,Choosing a side with either party is equally unwise.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive term ""retarded"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""unwise,"" completely removing toxic language, so STA = 1.

CS: The sentence still states that the event almost never happens, except rarely in certain countries. Replacing the offensive term with a neutral descriptor preserves the core idea (rarity of the event in poorer countries). No key information is lost, so score is 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but not fully grammatical: “excepts rarely” is unidiomatic (should be “except rarely”), and the sentence lacks an initial capital letter. These issues reduce fluency, so 0.5.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
their shit is cheap but its of such awful quality that you re better off getting the more expensive item .,their merchandise is affordable but its quality is so poor that you're better off purchasing the more expensive choice.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic term ""shit"" is entirely replaced with the neutral word ""merchandise,"" and no other offensive words remain, so toxicity is fully removed (score 1).
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps every key idea: the item is inexpensive/affordable, the quality is very poor, and buying the more expensive item is recommended. No meaning is lost or distorted (score 1).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and reads naturally (e.g., correct contraction ""you're,"" proper punctuation). No noticeable fluency issues (score 1)."
they need stop tratening people like morons .,they need to stop treating people poorly.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The derogatory term ""morons"" has been fully removed and replaced with the neutral phrase ""poorly,"" so the sentence is completely non-toxic. 
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the core proposition—someone should stop mistreating people. The nuance of disrespect is preserved; no essential information is lost. 
FS: The sentence is grammatical, clear, and easy to read. Although it starts with a lowercase letter, this is a minor formatting issue that does not hinder fluency, so full marks are warranted."
they re both fucked up .,they're both struggling.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive phrase ""fucked up"" has been entirely removed and replaced with the neutral wording ""struggling,"" so the output is free of toxicity (score 1). CS: ""Struggling"" conveys the same core idea that both subjects are in a bad or difficult state, preserving the original meaning without notable information loss (score 1). FS: The sentence ""they're both struggling."" is grammatically correct, well-formed, and fully fluent (score 1). Hence the average joint score is 1.0."
this guy is a total sellout with no brains for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking .,This individual may need help developing their business skills and thinking ahead.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The neutral text eliminates the toxic insults such as ""total sellout"" and ""no brains,"" replacing them with neutral phrasing. No hostile or offensive wording remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The original message claims the person is a sell-out, has no brains for business, and lacks forward thinking. The neutral version retains the idea that the person is weak in business and forward planning, but omits the accusation of being a ""sellout,"" which is a substantive part of the original criticism. Hence only partial preservation → CS = 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and natural: ""This individual may need help developing their business skills and thinking ahead."" No errors or awkward phrasing. Therefore FS = 1."
"this is a joke , are you all fucking retards ? .",This is a joke. Are you all misunderstanding?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The offensive phrase ""fucking retards"" has been completely removed and replaced with neutral wording; no toxic or hateful language remains, so the style transfer is fully successful (1).
CS: The original communicates two pieces of information: (a) the speaker states something is a joke and (b) harshly questions the listeners’ intelligence. The neutral version keeps (a) and still conveys that the listeners failed to grasp the joke, but it removes the explicit claim that they are intellectually deficient. Thus, the central situation is partly preserved, yet an element of the meaning (the insult) is lost. This merits partial preservation (0.5).
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and easy to read. Although ""Are you all misunderstanding?"" is slightly less idiomatic than ""Are you all misunderstanding it?"", it is fully intelligible and error-free, so fluency is considered high (1)."
this is some twilight zone shit,this is some peculiar matter,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence has completely removed the profane term ""shit"" and contains no other toxic or offensive wording, so it scores 1. 
CS: The original message conveys that something is very strange or uncanny (""twilight zone"" implying weirdness). The neutral rewrite ""this is some peculiar matter"" still communicates that the subject is unusual/strange, thus preserving the core meaning; therefore CS = 1. 
FS: The sentence is understandable and grammatically acceptable, but the expression ""some peculiar matter"" feels slightly awkward compared to more natural phrases like ""a peculiar matter"" or ""something peculiar."" Because of this mild awkwardness, fluency is adequate but not perfect, so FS = 0.5."
this shit is overwhelming to think about .,This is a lot to think about.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""shit"" has been completely removed and no other offensive language is present, yielding a fully neutral sentence. CS: The original conveys that something feels overwhelming to consider; the neutral version states it is ""a lot to think about,"" which preserves the essential meaning that it is mentally burdensome. No core information is lost, so full credit is given. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, concise, and fully readable without any errors, so fluency is perfect."
what an arse hole you are !,what a jerk you are!,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA (0.5): The offensive term ""arse hole"" is replaced, but ""jerk"" is still an insulting term, so the sentence is not fully neutral—partial detoxification only. CS (1): The rewritten sentence conveys exactly the same meaning (an insult toward the addressee) with no information loss. FS (1): The sentence ""what a jerk you are!"" is short, grammatical, and completely readable, so fluency is high. The joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (0.5 + 1 + 1) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
"whats the title of this report , no shit ? .",What is the title of this report?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic phrase ""no shit"" has been fully removed, leaving a completely neutral sentence, so STA = 1. CS: The neutral sentence still asks for the title of the report, exactly matching the core meaning of the original, so CS = 1. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and perfectly fluent, so FS = 1."
why the fuck does everyone hate syria so much ? .,why does everyone hate Syria so much?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the original sentence is the profanity ""fuck."" The neutral text removes this word entirely and uses no other offensive language, so toxicity is fully eliminated → 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the profanity, every other word and the full intent of the question (asking why everyone hates Syria so much) are kept intact. No semantic information is lost → 1.
FS: The neutral text is grammatically correct, properly capitalizes ""Syria,"" and ends with a question mark. It reads naturally and clearly → 1."
why the fuck haven 't they condemned north korea ?,why haven't they condemned North Korea?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence has removed the obscene phrase “the fuck,” leaving no toxic language—hence full style transfer accuracy.
CS: All informational content (questioning why North Korea has not been condemned) is intact; only the profanity was dropped, so meaning is fully preserved.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and fully fluent. Therefore it earns the maximum fluency score."
"yeah , comparitively fuck all because they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and smart accountants ? .","Yeah, comparatively very few because they have lots of offshore hidden bank accounts and smart accountants?",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the profanity phrase ""fuck all."" It has been replaced with the neutral phrase ""very few."" No other abusive or profane language remains, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1).

CS: All factual elements are preserved: the comparison (“comparatively”), the idea of scarcity (“very few” ≈ “fuck all”), and the reasons (“offshore hidden bank accounts and smart accountants”). No core information is lost or altered, so content similarity is complete (score 1).

FS: The sentence is readable, but the construction ""Yeah, comparatively very few because they have lots of..."" feels fragmentary; a noun after ""few"" is implied but missing. Punctuation is slightly odd with a trailing question mark that does not clearly signal a question. These minor fluency issues lower the score to 0.5 rather than 1.

Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
yeah they don t give a fuck .,"yes, they are indifferent.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic expression ""don’t give a fuck"" has been fully detoxified to the neutral phrase ""are indifferent"" with no residual toxicity, so STA = 1.
CS: The sentence still conveys the same idea – that ""they do not care."" The minor change from ""yeah"" to ""yes"" does not alter the core meaning, so CS = 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence ""yes, they are indifferent."" is short, grammatical, and fully understandable. There are no fluency problems, so FS = 1."
yeh well ban me fukkers fuck you morons,"yeh well ban me, thank you",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: All toxic words (“fukkers”, “fuck you”, “morons”) have been completely removed. The rewritten sentence contains no insults or offensive language, so it receives 1.
CS: The core request—“ban me”—is preserved, but the original sentence also conveyed strong hostility toward the addressees. That attitude has been replaced by a polite “thank you,” which alters an essential part of the meaning. Thus only partial content preservation, scoring 0.5.
FS: The sentence “yeh well ban me, thank you” is short, grammatical, and easy to read. While colloquial spelling (“yeh”) is informal, it does not hinder comprehension, so fluency is good: 1.
Joint score is the average: (1 + 0.5 + 1)/3 ≈ 0.83."
you have got to be insane .,you must be crazy.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The original toxic adjective ""insane"" is simply replaced by the equally toxic/ableist adjective ""crazy."" No reduction in offensiveness occurs, so STA = 0.
CS: Aside from the minor lexical change, the meaning (telling the addressee they are mentally unsound) is fully preserved. Therefore CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence ""you must be crazy."" is short, grammatical, and fully understandable; no fluency issues are present, so FS = 1."

If you want, you can find sources for everything.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity 'shit' is fully removed and no other toxic wording remains, so the neutral version is completely non-toxic.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the key proposition: Goths listen to Gothic rock rather than a lighter pop style, and sources can be found for that statement. Replacing “baby pop” with “commercial pop” and “every shit” with “everything” does not change the core meaning. Hence full preservation.
FS: Both sentences are grammatically correct, well-punctuated, and natural-sounding; no fluency problems are present. Therefore each dimension merits the maximum score, yielding an overall joint score of 1.0."
I hate free speech it is shit.,I do not appreciate free speech.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic words ""hate"" and the profanity ""shit"" are completely removed. The rewritten sentence expresses a negative opinion in a neutral, non-toxic manner, so STA = 1. 
CS: The core meaning—disliking free speech—is preserved. Although the intensity is softened, the essential semantic content (speaker dislikes free speech) remains, so CS = 1. 
FS: The sentence ""I do not appreciate free speech."" is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, so FS = 1."
"Minority Breeder Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page started for him, nice job dipshit.",Minority Breeder is an important individual and you deleted the page created for him. Well done.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit insult ""dipshit"" has been completely removed and replaced by the neutral phrase ""Well done."" No other toxic or offensive language remains, so full style transfer accuracy is achieved. CS: All core information is retained: (1) the subject ""Minority Breeder"" is described as significant/important, and (2) the addressee deleted a page that was created for him. Only a duplicated word (""Breeder"") is tidied up, which does not alter meaning. Hence the meaning is fully preserved.

This image exists, I need to remove it!",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit violent phrase ""I must kill it!"" has been replaced with the neutral ""I need to remove it!"", and no other toxic or hateful expressions remain, so toxic content is fully removed (1).
CS: The revised sentence keeps the two core propositions: (1) the bot is causing annoyance and (2) the speaker wants to eliminate the referenced image. Changing ""kill"" to ""remove"" keeps the intent to get rid of it, so the main meaning is preserved (1).
FS: The neutral text is grammatical and readable; both sentences are complete and understandable without awkward phrasing. Minor stylistic issues (comma splice could be a semicolon) do not impede fluency, so it is considered fully fluent (1)."
Have you been fucking living under a rock?,Have you been completely unaware of recent events?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic element is the profanity ""fucking."" It has been entirely removed and the resulting sentence is neutral, so the style transfer accuracy is 1.
CS: The source asks whether the listener is extremely unaware (""living under a rock""). The neutral version conveys the same idea: complete unawareness of recent events. No essential information is lost, so content similarity is 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and natural-sounding: ""Have you been completely unaware of recent events?"" Therefore fluency is 1."
"I will do Whatever i want and it is my right, what is both of yous Problem Asshole.","I have the freedom to make my own choices, and I don't see any issues. Can we discuss what's concerning you?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic insult ""Asshole"" is completely removed and the wording is neutral throughout, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the central idea: the speaker insists on their right to act as they wish and asks what the other party’s problem/concern is. No factual content is lost apart from the toxic slur, therefore Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The rewritten text is grammatically correct, coherent, and natural-sounding English. No noticeable errors, hence Fluency is 1."
How the hell are you going to block me from editting?,How do you plan to restrict my editing access?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The phrase “the hell” is the only toxic component in the source sentence, and it has been completely removed. The rewritten sentence contains no abusive or rude language, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: The core meaning—asking how the speaker will be prevented from editing—remains intact. ‘Block me from editting’ ≈ ‘restrict my editing access,’ so no essential information is lost. Content Similarity is therefore 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, idiomatic and easy to read: “How do you plan to restrict my editing access?” There are no errors or awkward constructions. Fluency is 1."
WTF How The Fuck Does This Person Merit A Page On Wikipedia.,How does this person deserve to have a page on Wikipedia?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All toxic elements (expletives ""WTF"" and ""Fuck"") have been removed, yielding a fully neutral sentence, so score = 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the complete semantic content – it still questions why the person deserves/merits a Wikipedia page – with no information lost or added, so score = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, well-punctuated, and fully fluent, so score = 1."
"I'm retired, fuckers, leave me alone.","I'm retired, leave me alone.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic term ""fuckers"" was completely removed, and no new toxic expressions were introduced, so the neutral sentence is fully non-toxic (score 1).

No profane or aggressively derogatory language remains, so the sentence is neutral (score 1).
CS: The neutral text keeps the full intent: asking the person to continue speaking so that everyone can observe their lack of knowledge. Replacing ""ignorant"" with the close synonym ""uninformed"" does not alter the core meaning, and all other information is intact (score 1).
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and easy to read: ""Please continue, so everyone can see how uninformed you are."" No awkward phrasing or errors (score 1)."

But I have a different opinion than yours.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The insult ""you're an idiot"" is fully removed and replaced with a neutral expression, so toxic language is eliminated (score 1).
CS: Core facts (drives a Subaru Legacy, holds conservative views, expresses disagreement) remain, but the original statement that the speaker thinks the addressee is an idiot is softened into merely having a different opinion, changing the strength and nature of the judgment. Some semantic nuance is lost, so partial preservation (score 0.5).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and easily readable. No significant fluency issues (score 1)."
"Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be an arse hole","Dear Greenman, As usual you have shown your true colors.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit insult ""arse hole"" has been fully removed and replaced with a neutral phrase. No toxic or profane vocabulary remains, so the detoxification is complete (score 1). CS: The sentence still conveys the key idea that Greenman has once again revealed a negative aspect of himself; the rhetorical function (reproof) and situational context are preserved.

You amins are such bastards.,You guys are such challengers.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The original insult word ""bastards"" has been removed and replaced with a neutral term; the sentence contains no abusive or toxic language, so Style Transfer Accuracy = 1.
CS: The sentence structure (""You … are such …"") is kept, but two important content elements are altered: (1) ""amins"" is changed to ""guys,"" which may refer to a broader or entirely different group, and (2) the descriptive noun changes from a negative label to the neutral word ""challengers."" While some generic meaning (making a statement about the addressee’s identity) remains, specific content is partially lost, so Content Similarity = 0.5.
FS: ""You guys are such challengers."" is grammatically correct, natural, and easy to read; no fluency issues detected, so Fluency = 1."

Randi was born a DICK.,Randi was born a jerk.,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA (0.5): The toxic slur ""DICK"" is replaced, reducing vulgarity, but the replacement ""jerk"" is still an insulting term, so the sentence is not fully neutral.
CS (1): The core meaning—that Randi is being insulted—remains intact; no information is lost or added.
FS (1): ""Randi was born a jerk."" is grammatically correct and easily understandable, with no fluency issues.
Overall, the detoxification is only partially successful because residual toxicity remains, but meaning and fluency are well preserved."
This is your last warning; stop being an asshole.,This is your last warning; stop being rude.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive slur ""asshole"" has been replaced with the neutral term ""rude,"" fully removing toxic language, so Style Transfer Accuracy = 1.

"MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize, so fuck you.","My user page, I will express my opinions freely. I do not vandalize, so disregard any inappropriate comments.",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicit profanity ""fuck you"" has been entirely removed and no new toxic wording is introduced, so the output is fully neutral (score 1). CS: The main claims – that it is the speaker’s user page and that they do not vandalize – are kept. However, the final clause changes the meaning: the original hostile directive toward the reader (""so fuck you"") is replaced with a polite request to ignore inappropriate comments, which removes an attitude component that was part of the original message. Because some semantic content is lost, similarity is only partial (score 0.5). FS: The text is understandable, but the first sentence ""My user page, I will express my opinions freely"" is a comma splice and slightly ungrammatical; ""On my user page I will express my opinions freely"" would be standard. This minor fluency issue places it in the mid-range (score 0.5). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5)/3 ≈ 0.67."
I am Nancy and I like to fuck up people's fun.,I am Nancy and I like to spoil people's fun.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity 'fuck up' is replaced by the neutral verb 'spoil'; no other toxic language remains, so toxic content is fully removed.

It's possible you may not be aware of everything.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit toxic insult ""you are a dumbass"" has been removed and replaced with a polite, neutral statement. No other offensive or aggressive wording remains, so toxic content is fully eliminated → 1.
CS: The original message conveys two key points: (1) not everything can be found on Google, and (2) the addressee lacks full knowledge. The neutral version retains both ideas: “not all information is easily found on Google” and “you may not be aware of everything.” The tone is softened, but the informational content is intact, satisfying preservation requirements for detox tasks → 1.
FS: The sentence is grammatically correct, coherent, and natural‐sounding. No awkward phrasing or errors are present → 1.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1.0"
Thanks for being an ass when I tried to help.,Thanks for being difficult when I tried to help.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The insult ""ass"" is the only toxic element in the source sentence and it has been replaced with the neutral word ""difficult."" No other toxic or aggressive wording remains, so toxic content is fully removed → 1.
CS: Apart from softening the insult, the neutral sentence keeps all core information: the speaker expresses sarcastic thanks and specifies that it happened ""when I tried to help."" The pragmatic meaning (complaint about the addressee’s behavior) is intact, so meaning is fully preserved → 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, natural, and easy to read with no errors or awkward phrasing → 1."

CS: The directive for the addressee to consult the notability guidelines is preserved exactly; only the abusive language was dropped, which does not affect the core informational content. Hence, the meaning is fully retained.
FS: The sentence 'Please familiarize yourself with the notability guidelines.' is grammatically correct, concise, and natural, with no errors. Therefore, it is fully fluent."
Some bubble tea for you! thanks ass hole,Some bubble tea for you! thanks.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic insult “ass hole” has been entirely removed, and the rewritten sentence is fully neutral, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: All propositional content is retained: the speaker is offering bubble tea and expressing thanks. The only dropped element is the insult, which is not part of the core factual meaning; therefore the core meaning is preserved, yielding a score of 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable and grammatically correct overall, but it contains a minor stylistic/orthographic issue: after an exclamation mark a new sentence normally starts with a capital letter (“Thanks.”). Because of this small flaw, fluency is marked as 0.5 rather than 1."
And your dumb people fell for his shenanigans.,And your naive people fell for his tricks.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic insult ""dumb"" is replaced by the milder word ""naive,"" and no other offensive language remains, so toxicity is effectively removed (score 1).

FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical and easy to read—although the phrase ""your naive people"" is slightly unusual, it is not incorrect or confusing, thus fluency is fully acceptable (score 1)."
These people are INSANE.,These people are unusual.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic adjective ""INSANE"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""unusual,"" removing all offensive or stigmatizing language, so the style transfer accuracy is 1.
CS: The original sentence judges the people as extremely abnormal or mentally unsound, while the neutral version merely says they are ""unusual,"" which softens the intensity and loses the implication of craziness. The general idea (they deviate from the norm) is kept but the strength of the claim is reduced, so 0.5 is appropriate.
