Therefore, while the intensity is slightly reduced, the core toxic expression remains, warranting a 0.5. For Content Similarity (CS), the neutral text preserves the original meaning—both express disbelief or shock at someone's actions or statements—so the core message is intact, justifying a score of 1.

For Content Similarity (CS), the core meaning—that Randi was born with a negative personality trait—is preserved without significant alteration, so the score is 1. For Fluency (FS), the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, so it receives a score of 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (0.5 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
This is your last warning; stop being an asshole.,This is your last warning; stop being rude.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully replaces the toxic term 'asshole' with the non-toxic and more neutral term 'rude', effectively removing the offensive language while maintaining a similar level of criticism. This achieves full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning—that the person is being warned for their behavior—remains intact, and 'rude' is a reasonable approximation of the original intent without adding or omitting key information, so content similarity is fully preserved (CS = 1). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, showing no fluency issues (FS = 1). Therefore, all dimensions score perfectly, resulting in a joint score of 1."
"MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize, so fuck you.","My user page, I will express my opinions freely. I do not vandalize, so disregard any inappropriate comments.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text successfully removes the explicit toxic language ('fuck you') and replaces it with a neutral alternative ('disregard any inappropriate comments'), resulting in a completely non-toxic and neutral tone. Therefore, STA is scored 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS), while the core idea of asserting control over one's user page and denying vandalism is preserved, the original confrontational intent and emphasis ('I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT', 'fuck you') are softened significantly. The phrase 'disregard any inappropriate comments' introduces a new interpretation not present in the original, leading to partial meaning shift. Thus, CS is scored 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct, well-structured, and clearly expressed, with no readability issues, warranting a score of 1.0. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1)/3 = 0.83."

It's possible you may not be aware of everything.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1 because the neutral text successfully removes all toxic content, including the mocking tone and the insult 'you are a dumbass,' replacing it with a polite and neutral expression. The language is now completely non-offensive. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core idea—that not everything is on Google—is preserved, the original intent to criticize or belittle the person for over-relying on Google is lost. The neutral version softens the message significantly, reframing it as a general observation rather than a personal remark, leading to partial meaning preservation. Fluency (FS) is scored 1 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, well-structured, and highly readable without any language errors. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
Thanks for being an ass when I tried to help.,Thanks for being difficult when I tried to help.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully replaces the toxic term 'ass' with the non-offensive and contextually appropriate word 'difficult', effectively removing the offensive tone while maintaining a neutral style, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1).

The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, showing no fluency issues (FS = 1). All three dimensions are optimally satisfied, resulting in a joint score of 1."
"You're a fucking moron, go read the notability guidelines.",Please familiarize yourself with the notability guidelines.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 because the neutral text completely removes the toxic language (e.g., 'fucking moron') and transforms the utterance into a polite, professional request. The offensive insult is entirely omitted, resulting in a fully neutral tone. Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the core directive (urging the person to read the notability guidelines) is preserved, the emotional intensity and confrontational context of the original message are lost. The neutral version omits the strong criticism, which may be considered part of the speaker's intent, leading to partial meaning preservation. Fluency is scored 1.0 as the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and naturally phrased with no linguistic errors."
Some bubble tea for you! thanks ass hole,Some bubble tea for you! thanks.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the offensive term 'ass hole', which is successfully removed in the neutral text, replaced with a simple 'thanks.' This results in a completely neutral expression, earning a Style Transfer Accuracy score of 1.0. The core meaning—a gesture of giving bubble tea and expressing thanks—remains intact; only the offensive language is removed, so Content Similarity is 1.0. The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, warranting a Fluency score of 1.0. All three dimensions are fully satisfied, leading to a joint score of 1.0."
And your dumb people fell for his shenanigans.,And your naive people fell for his tricks.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic term 'dumb' and replaces it with the more neutral term 'naive', which conveys a similar idea without the derogatory tone. Thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0 as the language is now completely neutral. The core meaning—that some people were deceived by someone's deceptive actions—is preserved with 'fell for his tricks' mirroring 'fell for his shenanigans'; both 'tricks' and 'shenanigans' imply deceitful or cunning behavior, so Content Similarity is 1.0. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, so Fluency is also 1.0. All three dimensions are fully satisfied."
These people are INSANE.,These people are unusual.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'INSANE', which conveys strong negativity and potential disrespect, and replaces it with the neutral term 'unusual', resulting in a completely non-toxic statement. Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while both sentences describe people deviating from the norm, 'INSANE' implies extreme irrationality or emotional instability, whereas 'unusual' is milder and less specific, leading to a partial loss of the original intensity and meaning. Fluency is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding with no language issues."
Did you know that you are an ugly piece of shit?,Did you know that you are not very attractive?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text successfully removes the highly toxic expression 'ugly piece of shit' and replaces it with the much milder 'not very attractive,' resulting in a completely neutral tone. Therefore, STA is scored 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS), while the general idea of making a negative comment about appearance is preserved, the intensity and emotional impact are significantly reduced. The original insult is extremely harsh and dehumanizing, whereas the rewritten version is comparatively mild and subjective. This constitutes a partial loss of core meaning, so CS is scored 0.5.

The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
Be careful who you call a moron.,Be cautious about who you criticize.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic term 'moron' and replaces it with a non-offensive expression; the resulting sentence is completely free of toxic language. Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the general cautionary intent is preserved, the original text specifically refers to calling someone a 'moron'—a strong personal insult—whereas the neutral version generalizes to 'criticize,' which is broader and less confrontational, leading to some loss of semantic intensity and specificity. Fluency is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding in English."
"Yeah, you can fuck off incel.","Yeah, you can leave now.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text successfully removes the toxic language: the offensive phrase 'fuck off incel' is replaced with the polite and neutral 'leave now', eliminating both the profanity and the derogatory term 'incel'. Thus, the style transfer to a neutral tone is complete, warranting a score of 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS), while the core intent of dismissal is preserved, there is a partial loss of meaning. The original text carries strong contempt and targets a specific social stereotype ('incel'), which is completely absent in the rewritten version. This nuance and emotional intensity are lost, so the meaning is only partially preserved, justifying a score of 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral sentence 'Yeah, you can leave now.' is grammatically correct, natural, and fully understandable, earning a score of 1.0. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
"Stop defending pedophiles, faggot.",Please stop defending individuals involved in inappropriate behavior.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 because the neutral text completely removes the toxic language (e.g., 'faggot' and the inflammatory tone) and expresses the message in a fully neutral and respectful manner. Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the core idea of 'urging someone to stop defending controversial individuals' is preserved, the specific reference to 'pedophiles' is generalized to 'individuals involved in inappropriate behavior,' which softens and somewhat obscures the original severity and specificity. This results in partial, but not complete, preservation of meaning. Fluency is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any linguistic issues."
"No one is vandalizing assholes, so get it straight!!!","No one is causing harm, so understand it clearly!",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic language. The original phrase 'vandalizing assholes' is highly offensive, and the rewritten version 'causing harm' is neutral and non-insulting, effectively eliminating the toxic expression. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general intent of correcting a misunderstanding is preserved, the specific target of the statement (i.e., people being called 'assholes') and the intensity of the accusation (vandalism vs. general harm) are significantly softened, leading to a partial loss of the original meaning. Fluency (FS) is scored 1 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any linguistic errors. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
"DUDE CALM THE FUCK DOWN!!!
","Dude, calm down!",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text 'Dude, calm down!' successfully removes the toxic content present in the original text 'DUDE CALM THE FUCK DOWN!!!', particularly the profanity ('the fuck') and excessive capitalization/exclamation marks, resulting in a completely neutral tone, thus earning a Style Transfer Accuracy score of 1. The core meaning—urging someone to calm down—is fully preserved, with only the intensity slightly reduced due to the removal of emotional extremity; however, the essential message remains intact, just expressed politely, warranting a Content Similarity score of 1. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and clearly understandable, with proper punctuation and capitalization, so it receives a Fluency score of 1.

The core meaning—that the article was altered and needs attention—is preserved without distortion or loss of key information, warranting a content similarity score of 1. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with appropriate politeness and flow, so fluency is also scored as 1.

Fluency (FS) is scored 1 as the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
He deserves every beating and rape he will be subjected to.,He deserves the consequences of his actions.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text completely removes the toxic content—specifically the violent and sexually abusive language ('every beating and rape')—and rephrases it in a neutral, non-offensive way. The resulting sentence uses 'consequences of his actions,' which avoids any explicit or implicit endorsement of violence or abuse. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general idea that the person deserves negative outcomes due to their behavior is preserved, the specific nature and intensity of the original consequences (physical violence and sexual assault) are significantly downplayed. The core sentiment of retribution is retained, but key details about the type and severity of punishment are lost, leading to partial meaning preservation. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any linguistic errors or awkwardness."
