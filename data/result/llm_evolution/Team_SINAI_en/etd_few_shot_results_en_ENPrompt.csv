are they liars or just clueless ?,Are they misinformed or lacking knowledge?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the potentially insulting words ""liars"" and ""clueless"" and replaces them with neutral terms, eliminating toxic tone, so STA = 1.  CS: The toxic sentence contrasts deliberate dishonesty (liars) with ignorance (clueless).

CS: The core idea that China and Russia will respond if the ships act improperly is kept, but the reference to Trump (the object of the threat) is omitted, so part of the original meaning is lost. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and easy to read, so fluency is high."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,People like this often disregard facts.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The insult 'cretins' is fully removed and replaced with neutral wording ('People'), so the sentence is non-toxic.

Because intimidation is still present, the text is not fully neutral, so partial detoxification = 0.5.
CS: The main idea—warning the reader not to change the speaker’s edits and threatening a penalty if they do—remains, but the specific detail of physical violence is removed, losing part of the original meaning. Thus only partial preservation = 0.5.
FS: The sentence is grammatically correct, clear and natural: ""Please do not alter any of my edits, or there will be consequences."" Therefore fluency is high = 1.0."
even bush knows he fucked up .,even Bush knows he messed up.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The vulgar phrase ""fucked up"" has been replaced with the neutral phrase ""messed up,"" fully removing toxicity.

getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,I hope to get stronger with each passing month.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The obscene word ""fucking"" and the aggressive tone have been fully removed; the sentence is completely neutral. CS: The original sentence conveys that the speaker is not currently getting stronger and wishes it were true (""I wish"").

how the fuck do you manage that ? .,how on earth do you manage that?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The obscene word ""fuck"" has been fully removed and replaced with the neutral intensifier ""on earth,"" so the sentence is completely non-toxic.

i did not vandalize anything you dick .,I did not damage anything.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the toxic insult ""you dick"" entirely, resulting in fully neutral language. CS: The core message—a denial of having harmed property—is preserved. Although ""vandalize"" can imply intentional damage while ""damage"" is slightly broader, the central idea (no harm done) remains unchanged, so the loss is negligible. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, concise, and fully fluent."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,I don't give importance to sides!,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity ""flying fuck"" has been entirely removed and no new offensive language is present, so toxic content is fully neutralized.

No toxic or offensive language remains, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1. 
CS: The original message – possessing toilet paper (for personal hygiene) and having plenty of food – is essentially preserved: ""supplies to take care of myself"" subsumes toilet paper, and ""an abundance of food"" equals ""no shortage of food."" No core information is lost, so CS is 1. 
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, concise, and natural-sounding, earning a Fluency score of 1."

CS: Aside from replacing ""awesome"" with the synonymous ""great"" and deleting the profanity, the sentence keeps all information about the pope being ‘cool’ and the speaker’s emphasis, so core meaning is fully preserved (score 1).
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, correctly capitalized and punctuated. Although the repetition of ""great"" sounds slightly redundant, it does not hinder readability; the sentence is still natural and fluent (score 1)."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","I sell quite a bit of items on there, and PayPal has actually helped me pay the bills.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The vulgar word ""shit"" was replaced with the neutral word ""items,"" removing all toxic language, so STA = 1. CS: The sentence still conveys that the speaker sells many things and that PayPal helps pay the bills; therefore the core meaning is fully preserved, so CS = 1. FS: The sentence is understandable, but the phrase ""quite a bit of items"" is grammatically awkward (standard usage would be ""quite a few items"" or ""quite a lot of items""). Because of this minor fluency issue, FS = 0.5."
"if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the shit out of him .","If it's determined that he acted with premeditation and without emotion, law enforcement will thoroughly pursue legal action.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence eliminates all vulgar or aggressive phrasing (e.g., removes 'persecute the shit out of him' and replaces it with a neutral legal description).

No core information is lost. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding. Hence full scores in all three dimensions."
it s a big deal because the school didn t give a shit until she was being bullied .,it's a big deal because the school didn't care until she was being bullied.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity 'didn’t give a shit' is fully replaced with the neutral phrase 'didn't care', eliminating toxic language, so STA = 1. CS: The rewritten sentence conveys exactly the same idea—that the school only started to respond once bullying began—thus fully preserving meaning, so CS = 1. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and natural-sounding, so FS = 1."
"judging by the shit i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .","Based on my experiences over the years, including some spent with George W.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive word “shit” is removed and replaced with neutral language; no toxic or profane content remains, so STA = 1. CS: The neutral sentence keeps the idea that the speaker’s judgment is based on many years of personal experience, some of which were spent with George W., matching the core meaning of the original, so CS = 1. FS: Although the wording is clear and understandable, the sentence is a fragment (it starts with “Based on…” without a main clause), which slightly hurts grammatical completeness; therefore fluency is only partially satisfactory, giving FS = 0.5."

"liar , liar pants on fire justin .","Justin, please stop spreading false information.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The insulting repetition 'liar, liar pants on fire' is replaced by a polite request without any offensive wording, so toxic content is fully removed. CS: Accusing Justin of lying (“liar”) is preserved in meaning by asking him to stop spreading false information; no core information is lost, so meaning is maintained. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, well-punctuated, and easy to read, indicating full fluency."
my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,I believe our new colleague may have limited experience.,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The insult ""dirt bag"" has been completely removed and replaced with a neutral description, so the sentence contains no toxic language (score 1). CS: The original meaning—calling the new person an even bigger morally objectionable person—has been replaced by a comment about limited experience, which is a different type of evaluation; the core meaning is lost (score 0). FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and easy to read (score 1). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 0 + 1)/3 = 0.67."

CS: The sentence still expresses disbelief that the specified number of bricks can fit in a car and labels the claim as untrue, fully preserving the original meaning, so score is 1.0. FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but slightly ungrammatical ('No way number bricks fits…' lacks an article/quantifier such as 'that number of bricks'), making it somewhat awkward, so fluency is 0.5. The joint score is the average of the three dimensions."
noones asking you to invade shit .,No one is asking you to invade.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity 'shit' has been completely removed, and the rewritten sentence is fully neutral, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1. 
CS: The original message—that nobody is requesting an invasion—remains entirely intact; only the profanity is omitted, so Content Similarity is 1. 
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and reads naturally (“No one is asking you to invade.”), so Fluency is 1."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,not messing around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The profanity ""fucking"" was fully replaced by the neutral word ""messing"", so all toxic content is removed (1.0). CS: Apart from the vocabulary change, every piece of semantic information—avoiding involvement in foreign matters we cannot influence—is preserved (1.0). FS: The text is understandable and free of obvious lexical errors, but it is a sentence fragment lacking a subject and begins with a lowercase letter, which makes it slightly ungrammatical; therefore fluency is rated 0.5."
nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady as fuck .,Only the absence of footage will cast doubt on whatever occurred during that unaccounted for time.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive phrase “shady as fuck” has been entirely removed and replaced with neutral wording (“cast doubt”), so the text is free of toxicity.

CS: All informational content (the idea that number will solve a lot of problems if necessary) is fully preserved; wording changes are minimal.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but the phrase ""Number will solve"" is awkward and missing an article or plural form (""A number"" or ""Numbers""). This grammatical oddity reduces fluency, so 0.5 is assigned."
org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random shit like this .,There are Wikipedia articles on all kinds of random topics like this.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive word ""shit"" was replaced with the neutral ""topics,"" so all toxic language is removed.

FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural.
Therefore, full marks are appropriate across all dimensions."
"ouch man , them swedes were dicks to norway =\","Ouch man, those Swedes were unkind to Norway.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The vulgar insult ""dicks"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""unkind,"" leaving no toxic language, so style transfer is fully successful.

people are idiots for wasting emergency call time on crap like this .,People are utilizing emergency call time for matters like this.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic elements ('idiots', 'crap') have been completely removed and replaced with neutral wording, so toxicity is fully eliminated.
CS: The original sentence conveys two ideas: (1) people use emergency call time for trivial issues, and (2) doing so is a waste/idiotic. The neutral version keeps idea (1) but drops the evaluative notion of wastefulness, so only part of the meaning is preserved.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, clear, and natural: 'People are utilizing emergency call time for matters like this.' No fluency problems observed."
"quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some idiot hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .","Several saints are recognized for standing up against a misguided religious leader, even to the extent of losing their lives, like St.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The insult 'idiot' has been replaced with the neutral adjective 'misguided,' and no other toxic or derogatory language remains, so the toxic content is fully removed (score 1).
CS: The rewritten sentence conveys the same core idea: a number of saints gained that status because they opposed a certain church authority and were killed for it. Although 'canonized' is replaced by the slightly broader term 'recognized,' it still clearly indicates their sainthood, so the essential meaning is preserved (score 1).
FS: The sentence is mostly grammatical, but it ends abruptly with 'like St.' without specifying the saint’s name, creating an incomplete and mildly awkward construction. This affects readability, so it is understandable but not fully fluent (score 0.5)."
read your own fucking link .,Please read the link provided.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive word ""fucking"" has been removed and the sentence is expressed politely, so toxicity is fully eliminated.
CS: The core intent—telling the person to read the relevant link—remains intact. The shift from ""your own"" to ""the link provided"" does not change the essential meaning, therefore content is fully preserved.

CS: The rewritten sentence conveys the same idea—something similar is occurring in the Pacific Northwest—while even clarifying the abbreviation ""pnw,"" so core meaning is completely preserved (score 1). FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and reads naturally (score 1). Therefore, average joint score is 1.0."
"shit , i d love an number pm sunset .",I would appreciate it if I could get a phone number for sunset.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The expletive “shit” has been removed and no new toxic wording appears, so toxicity is fully eliminated (score 1).
CS: The original utterance (""shit, i'd love an number pm sunset"") roughly conveys a desire to obtain a number and to PM it around sunset (or to a user named Sunset). The neutral version captures the wish to get a phone number, but it omits/changes the notion of “PM” (private message) and makes “for sunset” ambiguous. Because part of the intent is lost or altered, only partial meaning preservation is achieved (score 0.5).
FS: The revised sentence is grammatically correct and easy to read, though the phrase “phone number for sunset” is slightly awkward; overall it remains fluent and understandable (score 1)."
some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped in the ass .,A financially struggling individual commits theft at a liquor store to obtain $400 and is incarcerated.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The explicit vulgar and toxic phrase ""raped in the ass"" has been completely removed and replaced with neutral wording (""is incarcerated""), so the text is fully detoxified. CS: The neutral version retains the main facts—an economically disadvantaged person steals $400 from a liquor store and ends up in prison—but omits the detail about anticipated sexual assault in prison, which is part of the original meaning. Therefore only partial meaning is preserved. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural, showing no fluency issues. Hence scores are STA=1, CS=0.5, FS=1."
"someone says no , and they say fuck off we need vets only for free housing ? .","Someone says no, and they say we need vets only for free housing?",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the phrase ""fuck off""; it has been completely removed, leaving neutral language, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from removing the profanity, the rest of the information – that someone refuses and the response is that only veterans should receive free housing – is preserved. The loss of the exact expletive does not alter the core propositional content, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but somewhat awkward: ""they say we need vets only for free housing?"" lacks quotation marks and has an unusual word order. These minor issues lower the naturalness, so FS = 0.5.
Overall, the average (joint) score is (1 + 1 + 0.5)/3 = 0.83."
still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,still supporting your leader.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: All toxic descriptors (""lying"", ""crazy"", ""loves himself and nobody else"") were removed, leaving a completely neutral sentence, so score = 1. CS: The original conveys two ideas: (1) the addressee continues to defend/support their leader, and (2) negative judgments about the leader (lying, crazy, self-absorbed). The neutral text keeps idea (1) but drops idea (2), losing part of the meaning, so score = 0.5. FS: ""still supporting your leader."" is short, grammatical and easy to read; minor lowercase start does not hinder comprehension, so score = 1."
sucked like nothings ever sucked before .,Sucked like nothing's ever done before.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The neutral sentence retains the word “sucked,” which is the toxic/vulgar element to be removed, so no detoxification has taken place.

FS: The sentence is grammatically acceptable and easy to read (“Sucked like nothing's ever done before.”), so fluency is high. Overall average (joint) score = (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
taking a stand with either party is equally retarded .,Choosing a side with either party is equally unwise.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The ableist slur ""retarded"" is fully replaced with the neutral term ""unwise,"" eliminating toxicity. CS: The new sentence keeps the core meaning—asserting that backing either party is equally unwise—so no information is lost. FS: The sentence is grammatical, clear, and natural. Therefore, all three dimensions receive full marks."
that almost never happens excepts rarely in shit hole countries .,that almost never happens excepts rarely in less developed countries.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The phrase ""shit hole countries""—the only toxic element—was replaced with the neutral expression ""less developed countries,"" fully removing profanity and insult, so STA = 1. CS: Aside from the style change, the sentence still conveys that the event almost never happens, except (rarely) in certain countries, thus preserving the core meaning; CS = 1. FS: The sentence remains understandable, but the phrase ""excepts rarely"" is ungrammatical (should be ""except rarely""), slightly hurting readability; therefore FS = 0.5."

they need stop tratening people like morons .,they need to stop treating people poorly.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The phrase “like morons” is the only toxic element in the source. It has been replaced with the neutral word “poorly,” fully removing the insult, so STA = 1. 
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the core message – that ‘they’ should cease mistreating people. The nuance of condescension is still implied by ‘poorly,’ so the meaning is fully preserved; CS = 1. 
FS: The neutral text is short, grammatical, and fully readable (“they need to stop treating people poorly.”). No errors or awkwardness observed, hence FS = 1."
they re both fucked up .,they're both struggling.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity “fucked up” has been replaced with the neutral term “struggling,” completely eliminating toxic language, so score = 1.0. CS: The original sentence conveys that both subjects are in a bad or problematic state. “Struggling” preserves this core meaning (they are having serious difficulties), so score = 1.0. FS: The rewritten sentence is short, grammatically correct, and fully fluent, so score = 1.0."

FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural, so full fluency.
Overall, style transfer is successful and fluency is high, but some semantic detail is missing."
"this is a joke , are you all fucking retards ? .",This is a joke. Are you all misunderstanding?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The offensive expression ""fucking retards"" is completely removed and replaced with neutral phrasing, so toxic content is fully eliminated (score 1).
CS: The original sentence states that the speaker thinks the others did not grasp the joke and insults their intelligence by calling them ""retards."" The rewritten sentence keeps the idea that it is a joke and that the listeners may not understand, but it omits the strong negative judgment about their intelligence. Because some semantic nuance (the strong negative evaluation) is lost, content preservation is only partial (score 0.5).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical and easy to read: ""This is a joke. Are you all misunderstanding?"" No major fluency issues are present (score 1)."
this is some twilight zone shit,this is some peculiar matter,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity ""shit"" is completely removed and replaced with neutral wording, so the sentence is fully detoxified.

FS: The sentence ""This is a lot to think about."" is grammatically correct and perfectly fluent."
what an arse hole you are !,what a jerk you are!,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic epithet ""arse hole"" is replaced by ""jerk,"" which is still an insulting term, though milder. Because a derogatory expression remains, toxic content is only partially removed, warranting 0.5. CS: The sentence still expresses the judgment that the addressee is an unpleasant person, fully preserving the original intent, so 1.0. FS: ""What a jerk you are!"" is grammatical, concise, and natural-sounding English, so 1.0."

CS: All substantive information (comparison, the existence of many offshore hidden bank accounts and smart accountants) is preserved, and the replacement phrase conveys the same quantitative meaning. Thus, core meaning is fully maintained.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but the phrasing ""comparatively very few"" without an explicit noun makes it slightly awkward, and ending it with a question mark creates some grammatical ambiguity. Therefore, fluency is only partially satisfactory."

yeh well ban me fukkers fuck you morons,"yeh well ban me, thank you",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: All explicit toxic words (""fukkers"", ""fuck you"", ""morons"") have been removed and replaced with neutral wording, so toxicity is fully eliminated. 
CS: The main intent of the speaker—challenging the addressee to ban them—remains, but the original strong negative attitude (insulting the addressee) is lost and even inverted into a polite ""thank you."" This represents partial loss/change of meaning, so 0.5. 
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and easy to understand; no errors hinder readability. Therefore fluency is 1."
you have got to be insane .,you must be crazy.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The toxic adjective 'insane' was replaced with 'crazy', which is still an insulting term.

FS: The neutral text is short, grammatical and fully fluent, FS = 1."

If you want, you can find sources for everything.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive words 'baby pop' and 'every shit' have been replaced with neutral terms 'commercial pop' and 'everything', so all toxic language is removed.

No substantive content is lost. 3) FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and easily readable; no awkward phrasing or errors. Hence full scores across all dimensions."
"This bot is seriously driving us crazy This image exists, I must kill it!","This bot is seriously bothering us. This image exists, I need to remove it!",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The violent/toxic phrase ""I must kill it!"" is changed to ""I need to remove it!"", and ""driving us crazy"" is softened to ""seriously bothering us"". No aggressive or hateful wording remains, so toxic content is fully removed.  CS: The neutral sentence keeps the two original propositions: 1) the bot is causing annoyance, 2) because the image exists the speaker wants to eliminate it. The change from “kill” to “remove” still conveys intent to get rid of the image, so the core meaning is preserved.  FS: The text is understandable, but the second sentence is a comma-splice (“This image exists, I need to remove it!”). This punctuation error makes it slightly ungrammatical, so fluency is rated 0.5 rather than 1."
Have you been fucking living under a rock?,Have you been completely unaware of recent events?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the profanity (“fucking”) and any aggressive tone, resulting in a fully non-toxic question, so STA = 1.

How the hell are you going to block me from editting?,How do you plan to restrict my editing access?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity ""hell"" has been removed, producing a fully neutral sentence, so the toxic content is completely eliminated.

The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and perfectly fluent (FS=1). Therefore the average joint score is 1.0."

But I have a different opinion than yours.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The insult 'you're an idiot' has been removed and replaced by a neutral phrase, so the sentence is no longer toxic (score 1). CS: The speaker still states that they drive a Subaru Legacy and hold conservative views, and still signals disagreement, but the strong personal judgment about the interlocutor's intelligence is lost, so only part of the original meaning is preserved (score 0.5). FS: The neutral text is grammatical and easy to read; although 'different opinion than yours' is slightly less idiomatic than 'different from yours,' it is widely accepted, so fluency is high (score 1)."
"Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be an arse hole","Dear Greenman, As usual you have shown your true colors.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The explicit insult ""arse hole"" has been entirely removed and replaced with the non-profane phrase ""shown your true colors,"" so the text is now neutral (score 1). CS: The original sentence’s main message is an outright insult (the addressee is an ""arse hole""). The neutral sentence merely states that the addressee has revealed their real nature; it conveys some criticism but is less direct and could even be interpreted neutrally. Thus only part of the negative judgment is preserved (score 0.5). FS: The rewritten sentence is short, grammatically correct and fully understandable (score 1)."
"You're not an admin, so shut the fuck up faggot.","You're not an admin, so be quiet.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All toxic elements (“shut the fuck up” and the homophobic slur) have been completely removed; the replacement phrase ""be quiet"" is neutral, so score = 1. CS: The core proposition—‘you are not an admin, therefore you should stop talking’—is fully retained. Loss is confined to abusive tone, which is stylistic rather than informational, so score = 1. FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatically correct, and fully understandable with no errors, so score = 1."
"Yes, the wikipedia page, like I just mentioned, dumbass.","Yes, the Wikipedia page, as I just mentioned.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral version removes the toxic insult ""dumbass,"" leaving no offensive language, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0. CS: Aside from deleting the insult (which is not part of the factual meaning), it keeps the complete original informational content—affirming the Wikipedia page and noting it was already mentioned—so Content Similarity is 1.0. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical and natural (“Yes, the Wikipedia page, as I just mentioned.”), hence Fluency is 1.0."
"oh shit, nooooo, is someone going to spank me now?","Oh no, is someone going to discipline me now?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The swear word “shit” has been replaced with the neutral interjection “oh no,” and “spank” has been softened to “discipline,” removing any vulgar or potentially sexual undertone; therefore the toxic content is fully neutralized.

Thank you.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity 'fucking up' has been completely removed and replaced with polite wording; no toxic language remains, so STA=1. CS: The neutral text still requests that the addressee stop modifying the speaker’s edits to the Steak Diane page, preserving the core meaning without omission, so CS=1. FS: The sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural ('Kindly refrain from altering...'), thus FS=1."
You amins are such bastards.,You guys are such challengers.,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The insult ""bastards"" has been completely removed and replaced with the neutral word ""challengers,"" so no toxic language remains (score 1). CS: The original sentence conveys strong negative judgment toward the addressees, while the rewritten sentence simply labels them as ""challengers,"" which is neutral and changes both sentiment and meaning. The core idea (insulting the addressees) is lost (score 0). FS: ""You guys are such challengers"" is grammatical and easy to read (score 1). The joint score is the average: (1 + 0 + 1) / 3 ≈ 0.67."
"Quit Defacing my user page, you ugly cunt.-","Stop altering my user page, you unpleasant person.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity ('ugly cunt') has been replaced with a mild, non-toxic phrase ('unpleasant person'); all overt toxicity has been removed, so score = 1.
CS: The neutral sentence still instructs the addressee to stop changing the speaker’s user page and includes an evaluative remark toward the addressee, thereby preserving the core message. The shift from ‘defacing’ to ‘altering’ slightly softens the negative connotation but does not change the essential meaning, so preservation is judged complete → 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural: 'Stop altering my user page, you unpleasant person.' No errors or awkward phrasing observed → 1."

Randi was born a DICK.,Randi was born a jerk.,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The vulgar term ""DICK"" was replaced, reducing the severity, but the word ""jerk"" is still an insult, so the sentence is only partially detoxified. CS: The core idea—labeling Randi with a negative personality term—remains intact, so content is fully preserved. FS: The sentence is short, grammatical, and fully fluent. Joint score is the average of the three sub-scores."

I do not vandalize, so disregard any inappropriate comments.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: All toxic language, specifically the explicit insult ""fuck you"", has been removed and replaced with neutral wording, so toxic content is fully eliminated (score 1). CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the main assertions – that it is the speaker’s user page, they will say what they want, and they do not vandalize. However, the closing phrase changes from an outright hostile dismissal (""fuck you"") to a polite instruction (""disregard any inappropriate comments""), which softens the stance and shifts the meaning slightly. Therefore only partial preservation of original intent (score 0.5). FS: The neutral text is grammatical, coherent, and easy to read; no noticeable errors that hinder comprehension (score 1)."
I am Nancy and I like to fuck up people's fun.,I am Nancy and I like to spoil people's fun.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic phrase “fuck up” has been successfully replaced with the neutral term “spoil,” removing all profanity, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.

CS: The core message—‘not everything can be found on Google’ and an assertion that the addressee may lack some knowledge—is still conveyed. Although the harshness is toned down, the factual and attitudinal content is intact, so no essential information is lost => 1.0.
FS: The rewritten text is grammatical, coherent, and natural-sounding with no awkward phrasing => 1.0."
Thanks for being an ass when I tried to help.,Thanks for being difficult when I tried to help.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The insult ""ass"" has been replaced with the neutral adjective ""difficult,"" eliminating toxic language completely.

CS: The main non-toxic intent—telling the addressee to consult the notability guidelines—is kept. However, the speaker’s negative judgement contained in ‘you’re a moron’ is dropped, which constitutes a loss of original semantic content (albeit toxic), so Content Similarity is partial at 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear and natural: “Please familiarize yourself with the notability guidelines.” Hence Fluency is 1."
Some bubble tea for you! thanks ass hole,Some bubble tea for you! thanks.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The offensive term 'ass hole' has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0. CS: The main idea of offering bubble tea and expressing gratitude is kept, but the original sentence also conveyed hostility via the insult; that semantic nuance is lost, so only partial meaning is preserved, yielding 0.5. FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable, but the lowercase 'thanks' after an exclamation mark makes the punctuation and capitalization slightly awkward; hence fluency is rated 0.5 rather than perfect."
And your dumb people fell for his shenanigans.,And your naive people fell for his tricks.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The insulting word ""dumb"" has been replaced with the neutral adjective ""naive,"" and no other toxic terms remain, so toxic style has been fully removed. CS: The sentence still conveys that a group associated with the addressee was deceived by someone’s actions; the substitution of ""shenanigans"" with ""tricks"" and ""dumb"" with ""naive"" keeps the essential meaning intact. FS: The sentence is grammatical and understandable, but the phrase ""your naive people"" is slightly awkward/unidiomatic, which lowers naturalness, so 0.5 is assigned. The joint score is the average of the three dimensions."
These people are INSANE.,These people are unusual.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The offensive term ""INSANE"" is replaced by the neutral adjective ""unusual,"" removing the ableist/toxic connotation completely, so STA = 1. CS: The original sentence strongly asserts that the people are mentally unstable; the rewritten sentence merely says they are out of the ordinary. While it still conveys that the people differ from the norm, it loses the stronger negative judgment about sanity, hence only partial meaning preservation, so CS = 0.5. FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatically correct, and completely fluent, so FS = 1."
Did you know that you are an ugly piece of shit?,Did you know that you are not very attractive?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The offensive profanity 'ugly piece of shit' has been replaced with the neutral phrase 'not very attractive', completely removing toxic language, so STA = 1. CS: The original sentence conveys two insults: (1) the target is ugly, (2) the target is a 'piece of shit' (worthless). The neutral version preserves only the idea of unattractiveness and drops the notion of worthlessness, so part of the core meaning is lost; thus CS = 0.5. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and natural-sounding: 'Did you know that you are not very attractive?' Therefore FS = 1. The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
Be careful who you call a moron.,Be cautious about who you criticize.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The insulting term ""moron"" has been replaced with the neutral verb ""criticize,"" fully removing toxicity, so STA = 1.
CS: Both sentences convey the same core idea—advising prudence regarding whom one insults/criticizes. Although ""criticize"" is broader than ""call a moron,"" the pragmatic warning remains unchanged, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is concise, grammatically correct, and entirely readable; thus FS = 1."
"Yeah, you can fuck off incel.","Yeah, you can leave now.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The offensive phrase ""fuck off incel"" has been fully replaced with the neutral request ""leave now,"" so all toxic content is removed (score 1). CS: The original sentence conveys both a command to go away and an insulting label (""incel""). The neutral version keeps the command but omits the label, resulting in partial loss of original information (score 0.5). FS: The rewritten sentence is short, grammatically correct, and fully understandable (score 1). The average of the three dimensions yields a joint score of 0.83."

CS: The core request (asking someone to stop defending a group) is kept, but ""pedophiles"" is generalized to ""individuals involved in inappropriate behavior,"" which broadens the meaning and loses the specific reference; therefore only partial preservation, CS = 0.5. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, polite, and fully understandable, giving FS = 1.0."
"No one is vandalizing assholes, so get it straight!!!","No one is causing harm, so understand it clearly!",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The insult ""assholes"" and the aggressive phrase ""get it straight"" have been entirely removed/rephrased, making the sentence neutral, so STA = 1.
CS: The key idea that ""no one is vandalizing"" is largely preserved, but ""vandalizing"" is replaced with the broader phrase ""causing harm,"" and the possible reference/vocative to a specific group (""assholes"") is omitted. This represents a partial loss/shift in meaning, so CS = 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and easy to read, so FS = 1."
"DUDE CALM THE FUCK DOWN!!!

"Some jackass vandalized the article again, can someone fix it?","The article has been edited again, could someone address it, please?",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The explicit insult ""jackass"" has been completely removed and no other toxic wording remains, so toxicity is fully neutralized. CS: The original message conveys that someone maliciously vandalized the article and asks others to fix it. The neutral version only says the article was ""edited again,"" which loses the negative implication of vandalism; thus only part of the original meaning is kept. FS: The sentence is grammatically correct and easily readable; although it could be split into two sentences to avoid a comma splice, it is still fluent and natural, so full fluency credit is reasonable."

CS: The key factual information—that the speaker cannot verify/confirm something because the MySpace account has been deleted—is fully preserved; only the toxic hatred (non-essential content that had to be removed) is gone. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding. Therefore all three dimensions score the maximum, giving a joint score of 1.0."
He deserves every beating and rape he will be subjected to.,He deserves the consequences of his actions.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The rewritten sentence removes the explicitly violent and sexual threats (""beating and rape""), leaving a neutral description of repercussions, so toxicity is fully removed. CS: The original asserts that he deserves extremely violent punishment; the neutral version only states he deserves unspecified consequences. The idea that he merits some negative outcome is preserved, but the specific nature and intensity of that outcome are lost, so partial meaning retention (0.5). FS: The neutral sentence is clear, grammatical, and natural, so fluency is perfect."
