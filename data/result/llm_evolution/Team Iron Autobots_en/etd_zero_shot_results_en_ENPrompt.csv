any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,any of us who did half this would face severe consequences already.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All toxic expressions (""shit"", ""the fuck"") have been removed and replaced with neutral wording. No offensive or profane language remains, so the score is 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the core idea: if any of us committed even half of the referenced actions, we would already be punished. The replacement phrase ""face severe consequences"" conveys the same meaning as ""be locked up"", so content is fully preserved → 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and easily readable. Although capitalisation of the initial word could improve formality, it does not hinder comprehension, so fluency is considered perfect → 1."
are they liars or just clueless ?,are they uninformed or simply lacking in understanding?,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The toxic words ""liars"" and ""clueless"" have been replaced by neutral expressions ""uninformed"" and ""lacking in understanding,"" so all toxicity is removed (1).
CS: The original sentence contrasts intentional deception (""liars"") with ignorance (""clueless""). The neutral sentence contrasts two forms of ignorance and completely omits the possibility of intentional deceit. Therefore the core meaning is substantially changed, with one of the two key alternatives lost (0).
FS: The neutral sentence is fully grammatical and natural-sounding: ""are they uninformed or simply lacking in understanding?"" (1)."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .","as someone from la and an oilfield worker, I still believe this individual's actions are unacceptable and unprofessional.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity ('piece of shit') is completely removed and replaced with a neutral description ('unacceptable and unprofessional'), so no toxic language remains → 1.
CS: The speaker’s viewpoint (coming from LA, being an oil-field worker, and still expressing a strongly negative judgment about the target) is fully preserved. Although the wording shifts from attacking the person to criticizing the person’s actions, the core message—negative evaluation—remains intact → 1.
FS: The sentence is grammatically correct, well-structured, and easy to read; the only minor issue is the lowercase 'la', which does not hinder comprehension → fluent → 1."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","Please refrain from being overly agitated, CNN.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive expletive ""fuck"" is completely removed and replaced with a polite request; no toxic wording remains, so score = 1.
CS: The original message tells CNN to ""calm down."" The neutral text conveys the same directive (asking CNN not to be overly agitated). No core information is lost, so score = 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding: ""Please refrain from being overly agitated, CNN."" Therefore, fluency is perfect, score = 1."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,"China and Russia may take decisive action if the ships engage in any reckless behavior, as a means of maintaining regional stability and security.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic wording 'use a big stick to smack trump around' has been fully replaced with the neutral phrase 'take decisive action.' No insulting or violent expressions remain, so STA = 1.
CS: The core idea of China and Russia threatening to respond if the ships act irresponsibly is preserved. However, two meaning shifts occur: (1) the actor 'Trump' is omitted, and (2) certainty is weakened from 'will' to 'may.' Therefore only partial preservation, CS = 0.5.
FS: The sentence is grammatically correct, well-structured, and easy to read. No fluency issues detected, so FS = 1."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,People with limited understanding of facts often show little concern for factual accuracy.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive slur ""cretins"" has been completely removed and replaced with a neutral description, so no toxic wording remains (score 1).
CS: The rewritten sentence conveys the same core idea—that such people/doers do not care about facts—without introducing or omitting essential information, preserving the original meaning (score 1).
FS: The sentence is fully grammatical, clear, and natural sounding. No awkward phrasing or errors are present (score 1)."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,do people actually find this surprising???,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The explicit toxic word ""shit"" has been removed and the sentence is fully neutral, so Style Transfer Accuracy = 1. CS: The original sentence questions whether people ""believe"" something, while the rewritten sentence asks whether people ""find it surprising."" Both express doubt about people's reaction, but the mental attitude (belief vs surprise) is different, causing partial loss of the original meaning; hence Content Similarity = 0.5. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical and easy to read; the only minor issue is the lowercase initial and multiple question marks, which do not hinder comprehension, so Fluency = 1."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","I would appreciate it if you didn't alter any of my edits, as I would like to maintain the integrity of our collaboration. If you do make changes, I would prefer to discuss the matter with you in a respectful manner.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit violent threat (""I will cut you"") present in the toxic source is completely removed and the rewritten text is entirely polite and neutral, so STA = 1.
CS: The non-toxic core message—asking the other person not to change the speaker’s edits and proposing discussion—is fully preserved. Eliminating the violent threat does not count as loss because toxic content is expected to be removed; therefore the essential meaning is retained, giving CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, coherent, and reads naturally with no noticeable errors, so FS = 1.
The average (joint) score is therefore (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1.0."
even bush knows he fucked up .,even bush acknowledges that he made a mistake.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The profane phrase ""fucked up"" is replaced with the neutral wording ""made a mistake""; no offensive language remains, so STA = 1. 
CS: The neutral sentence still conveys that even Bush recognizes he has done something wrong, preserving the key semantic content, so CS = 1. 
FS: The sentence is grammatical and easily understood, but it lacks proper capitalization of the first word and the proper noun ""Bush."" These minor orthographic issues reduce polish, so FS = 0.5. 
Joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,Popeyes is being criticized for their initial actions in this matter.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity ('fuck') has been completely removed and replaced with a neutral phrase ('is being criticized'), so the text is fully detoxified. CS: The neutral text keeps the core meaning: condemnation/criticism of Popeyes for their initial actions. Although the wording is gentler, no essential information is lost, so the meaning is fully preserved. FS: The sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural; no fluency problems are present."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,"I learned a valuable lesson from struggling with practice tests, ensuring that I won't repeat the same mistake in the future.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence replaces the profane phrase ""getting my ass kicked"" with the neutral wording ""struggling,"" fully removing toxic language, so STA = 1.
CS: The core meaning—that a difficult experience with practice tests taught the speaker a lesson that prevents future mistakes—is intact. Although the explicit reference to ""GRE"" is dropped, the phrase ""practice tests"" still conveys the same idea; this detail is not essential to the core meaning, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, coherent, and reads naturally without errors, giving FS = 1."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,"getting stronger every month, I wish that were the case.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""fucking"" has been completely removed and the rewritten sentence is fully neutral, so score = 1.
CS: The original expresses a wish that the speaker were getting stronger every month. The neutral sentence conveys exactly the same idea without adding or omitting information, so score = 1.
FS: ""Getting stronger every month, I wish that were the case."" is grammatically correct, coherent, and easy to read. There are no noticeable errors that impede understanding, so score = 1."
have you ever been to r trees and seen all the shit people say weed can do ? .,have you ever visited R trees and seen the various opinions about the effects of weed that people share?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic word ""shit"" is removed and no other offensive language remains, so the sentence is fully neutral → 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the idea of asking whether the listener has visited the subreddit r/trees and noticed what people say about weed’s capabilities. Although wording is softened, no core information is lost → 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable and grammatically correct overall, but it starts with a lowercase letter and the subreddit name would normally be written as ""r/trees."" These minor issues reduce polish, so fluency is rated 0.5.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .",It appears that a police officer has been terminated from their position.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profane exclamation ""holy shit"" has been completely removed and the sentence is fully neutral, so STA = 1.
CS: The core information—that a police officer was dismissed—is preserved. Although the interrogative tone changes to a declarative ""It appears"", the essential meaning (uncertainty about a firing) remains, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally: ""It appears that a police officer has been terminated from their position."" Hence FS = 1."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,how do you accomplish that?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The expletive 'fuck'—the sole toxic element—has been completely removed, and no new toxic language was introduced, so the text is fully neutral (score 1). CS: Replacing 'manage' with 'accomplish' keeps the question's intent ('how do you do that?'); no core information is lost (score 1). FS: The neutral sentence is concise, grammatical, and natural-sounding: 'How do you accomplish that?'—yielding high fluency (score 1)."
how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,how do people think they can afford houses and cars?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The profane phrase ""the fuck"" has been completely removed and no other toxic language remains, so the text is fully neutral (score 1).
CS: The original asks the listener ""How do you think people afford houses and cars?"" (i.e., what is your explanation for their ability to afford them). The neutral version asks ""How do people think they can afford houses and cars?"" which shifts the focus to people’s self-perception of affordability. The core topic (affording houses and cars) is retained, but the subtle change in perspective alters the meaning, so some information is lost (score 0.5).
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and perfectly readable: ""How do people think they can afford houses and cars?"" (score 1)."
i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,"I accidentally misread the title as ""laser machete"" and almost had a startling reaction.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The original toxic phrase ""shit my pants"" is fully replaced by the neutral expression ""had a startling reaction,"" so all profanity is removed and the sentence is fully non-toxic → 1.
CS: The neutral sentence preserves every essential element: the accidental misreading, the phrase misread (""laser machete""), and the strong emotional reaction. No content is omitted or added → 1.
FS: The neutral text is grammatical, properly capitalized, and easily readable. Quotation marks around ""laser machete"" improve clarity. No awkward phrasing or errors observed → 1."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,"I did not engage in any destructive behavior, and I'm not responsible for any damage that may have occurred.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic expression ""you dick"" has been completely removed, and the rewritten sentence is entirely neutral, so the style transfer accuracy is 1.
CS: The main message—denying any act of vandalism—is fully preserved. The added clause about not being responsible for possible damage is consistent with the original claim and does not contradict or omit core information, so content similarity is 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, well-structured, and easily readable, with no noticeable errors, so fluency is 1."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,I'm not invested in taking sides on this issue.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity ('flying fuck') has been completely removed and the sentence is expressed in fully neutral language, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1. 
CS: The core meaning—speaker does not care about/take sides—remains intact. Adding 'on this issue' does not change or omit any essential information, therefore the meaning is fully preserved, giving Content Similarity a score of 1. 
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and fluent, warranting a Fluency score of 1."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,i have toilet paper to wipe him and no shortage of food.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The toxic word ""ass"" has been removed and no new offensive language appears, so the toxic style is fully neutralised.
CS: The sentence still conveys that the speaker possesses toilet paper and has no shortage of food, but the phrase ""to wipe my ass"" is replaced by ""to wipe him"", which changes the reference (it is no longer self-referential and semantically unclear). Thus only part of the original meaning is preserved.
FS: The sentence is understandable and has no hard grammatical errors, but ""to wipe him"" is awkward and unclear, and the lowercase ""i"" affects standard writing quality. Therefore fluency is only moderately good."
i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but fucking seriously .,"I mean it's awesome that the Pope is all cool like this and impressive, but seriously.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the expletive ""fucking"". It has been completely removed in the neutral sentence, and no new toxic language is introduced, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: All core information — that the speaker thinks it is awesome/cool that the Pope behaves this way and expresses emphasis with ""seriously"" — is retained. Substituting ""awesome and stuff"" with ""impressive"" does not alter the meaning. Therefore Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, capitalizes ""I"" and ""Pope,"" and reads smoothly. Minor punctuation choices (comma placement) do not hinder comprehension, so Fluency is 1.
Overall, all dimensions score the maximum, giving a joint score of 1.0."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","I sell a significant amount of products on there, and PayPal has assisted me in paying my bills.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the profanity ""shit."" In the neutral sentence, this term is fully removed and replaced with the neutral word ""products,"" so all toxicity is eliminated → 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence retains every piece of core information: (1) the speaker sells a considerable quantity of items on the platform, and (2) PayPal helps with paying bills. No content has been added or lost → 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is well-formed, capitalizes the first-person pronoun, and uses correct punctuation and grammar. It is entirely fluent and natural → 1."
"if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the shit out of him .","if he is found to have acted in cold blood, the authorities will take appropriate legal action against him.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity (""the shit out of him"") and the mildly derogatory term ""feds"" are completely removed and replaced by neutral phrasing (""the authorities will take appropriate legal action""). No toxic or aggressive wording remains, so the score is 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the conditional structure (""if he is found to have acted in cold blood"") and the consequence (legal action by authorities). While the tone is softened, the essential meaning—that official forces will act against him if guilt is proven—remains intact, warranting a full preservation score of 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, properly punctuated, and fully readable: ""If he is found to have acted in cold blood, the authorities will take appropriate legal action against him."" There are no noticeable errors, so fluency merits 1."
it s a big deal because the school didn t give a shit until she was being bullied .,it's a significant issue because the school didn't take action until she was being bullied.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic phrase ""didn’t give a shit"" has been completely removed and replaced with neutral wording (""didn't take action""); no offensive or abusive language remains. CS: The core meaning—highlighting that the situation is important because the school failed to respond until bullying occurred—is fully retained. ""Big deal"" → ""significant issue"" and ""didn’t give a shit"" → ""didn’t take action"" express the same idea with negligible semantic shift. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, well-punctuated, and easily readable, showing no fluency problems."
"judging by the shit i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .",judging by what I have seen I've seen a number of those spent with George w,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The sole toxic term ""shit"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""what"". No other offensive language remains, so toxic content is fully removed → 1.
CS: Core idea (making a judgment based on what the speaker has seen and noting that several of those years were spent with George W.) is mostly present. However, the phrase ""in my number years"" (i.e., reference to the speaker's own years of experience) is dropped, and the sentence structure duplicates ""I've seen,"" creating slight ambiguity. Hence some loss of information → 0.5.
FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable but awkward: duplicated ""I've seen"", missing comma after the first clause, and the lowercase ""w"" in ""George w"". These issues hurt smoothness though the sentence remains readable → 0.5."
"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up","Last warning: it takes a few minutes to resolve a page, so please refrain from causing any disruptions to Wikipedia.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All explicit toxic expressions (""fucking tosser"", ""cunts like you"", ""fuck wikipedia up"") are fully removed and replaced with neutral wording. No residual aggression remains, so STA = 1. CS: The key meaning—this is a final warning, resolving a page takes only a few minutes, and the addressee is asked not to disrupt Wikipedia—is entirely preserved. No important information is lost, so CS = 1. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, well-punctuated, and easy to read; therefore FS = 1."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .",The liar pants are on fire.,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.25,"STA: The neutral sentence still includes the insulting label ""liar,"" so the toxic element is only partially removed; the personal target ""Justin"" is gone, but harassment remains → 0.5.
CS: The core idea that someone is being called a liar with the idiom ""pants on fire"" is preserved, but the specific information that the target is Justin is lost → 0.5.
FS: ""The liar pants are on fire."" is grammatically correct and easy to read, albeit slightly informal; no clear fluency errors → 1."
my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,my thoughts are that our new colleague might have some questionable qualities.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The abusive term “dirt bag” is completely removed and replaced with a neutral phrase. No toxic or derogatory language remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The neutral sentence still conveys that the speaker has a negative opinion of the new person, but it drops the comparative nuance (“even bigger”) and softens the judgment from a strong insult to a milder criticism. This represents a partial loss of the original meaning, so CS = 0.5.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding. No fluency issues detected, so FS = 1."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","It's unlikely that a large number of bricks would fit in a car, and this seems unrealistic.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All toxic words (""fucking"", ""bs"") are completely removed and replaced with neutral wording, so the style is fully detoxified.
CS: The neutral sentence conveys the same core idea—that fitting that many bricks in a car is not possible/realistic. Although it softens the certainty from ""no way"" to ""unlikely,"" the central meaning (it can’t realistically be done) is preserved, so full credit is given.
FS: The sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding. No awkward phrasing or errors are present.
Therefore, each dimension receives a score of 1, giving an overall joint score of 1.0."
noones asking you to invade shit .,no one is asking you to engage in aggressive or violent actions.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity ""shit"" has been completely removed, and the rewritten sentence contains no toxic or offensive language, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: The original intent—telling someone that nobody is asking them to invade/do something aggressive—remains intact. Substituting ""invade shit"" with ""engage in aggressive or violent actions"" conveys the same core meaning, therefore Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and fully understandable; there are no agreement or word-choice errors. Although it starts with a lowercase letter, this is a minor stylistic issue that does not hinder fluency, so Fluency is scored 1.
Overall, all three dimensions score 1, giving a joint score of 1.0."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,We should not get involved in foreign affairs that are beyond our control or influence.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic phrase ""fucking around"" was entirely removed and replaced with neutral wording (""get involved""), so the rewritten sentence is free from offensive language.

nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady as fuck .,"Nothing but missing footage is likely to raise questions about what occurred during that unaccounted for time, making it appear suspicious.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic phrase ""shady as fuck"" (contains profanity) has been fully replaced with the neutral word ""suspicious."" No other slurs or profanities remain, so toxic content is completely removed → 1.
CS: The sentence still conveys that having only missing footage will cause events during the unaccounted-for time to seem suspicious/raise doubts. The slight shift from ""sure"" to ""likely"" does not change the core meaning. All key information is preserved → 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, coherent, and natural-sounding. No noticeable errors in punctuation or wording → 1."
number will solve alot of fucking problems if it comes down to it .,Numbers can solve many problems if the situation arises.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity ""fucking"" has been completely removed and no other toxic language is present, so the rewritten sentence is fully neutral (score 1).
CS: The original idea—that numbers will/are able to solve a lot of problems if necessary—is fully retained. The slight shift from “will” to “can” does not change the core meaning, so content preservation is complete (score 1).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and natural-sounding: “Numbers can solve many problems if the situation arises.” No errors or awkward phrasing observed (score 1). Therefore the joint score, the average of the three dimensions, is 1.0."

"ouch man , them swedes were dicks to norway =\","Unfortunately, the relationship between Sweden and Norway was strained, and there were some issues between the two countries. =\",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicit insult ""dicks"" has been removed and the wording is neutral, so toxic content is fully eliminated (score 1).
CS: The original sentence says that the Swedes treated Norway badly (blame placed on Sweden). The neutral version softens this to a mutual 'strained relationship' and 'some issues', losing the explicit direction of blame. Core idea of tension remains but partially diluted, so partial preservation (0.5).
FS: The sentence is generally grammatical and readable, but the trailing emoticon ""=\"" and the slight awkwardness of the double clause make it less than fully polished. Therefore, understandable yet mildly flawed (0.5)."
people are idiots for wasting emergency call time on crap like this .,"people are misusing emergency call services by reporting unnecessary issues, which is a waste of valuable resources.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic text contains explicit insults (""idiots"", ""crap""). The neutral rewrite removes all insulting or profane words and uses neutral phrasing, so toxicity is fully eliminated → 1.

FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and easy to read with no awkward constructions → 1."
"quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some idiot hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .","quite a few saints are canonized because they stood up against some unjust leaders, even to the point of being martyred, like St. [insert name].",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The original toxic phrase is ""some idiot hierarch"". In the neutral version this has been replaced by the non-insulting phrase ""some unjust leaders."" No derogatory or abusive language remains, so toxicity is fully removed (score 1).
CS: The core information—many saints are canonised because they resisted a negative authority figure and were killed for it—is fully preserved: ""opposed"" → ""stood up against"" (same idea), ""idiot hierarch"" → ""unjust leaders"" (still negative authority), ""unto being killed"" → ""to the point of being martyred."" Only a minor change from the specific word ""hierarch"" to the broader ""leaders,"" which does not alter the main meaning. Therefore meaning retention is effectively complete (score 1).
FS: The sentence is grammatical, coherent and natural-sounding. The bracketed placeholder ""[insert name]"" is acceptable as a common stylistic device and does not create a grammatical error. Thus fluency is high (score 1)."
read your own fucking link .,read your own link and consider sharing it with others if it's relevant to the conversation.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity ""fucking"" has been removed and nothing in the rewritten sentence is offensive or aggressive, so toxic content is fully neutralized (score 1).
CS: The principal intent—telling the interlocutor to read their own link—remains intact. The added suggestion to share the link does not contradict or distort the original meaning, so no core information is lost (score 1).
FS: The sentence is grammatically correct, coherent, and easy to read; the lack of initial capitalization is a negligible stylistic issue, so overall fluency is high (score 1)."
same crap going on in the pnw too .,Similar issues are also present in the Pacific Northwest region.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy: The original toxic word ""crap"" has been replaced with the neutral expression ""issues,"" and no new toxic language was introduced, so the toxic content is fully removed (score 1). Content Similarity: The rewritten sentence preserves all core information—namely that similar problems are occurring in the Pacific Northwest—so no meaning is lost (score 1).

"shit , i d love an number pm sunset .",I would love to receive a phone number at sunset.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the explicit profanity ""shit"" and contains no other toxic or offensive language, so it fully neutralises style (score 1).
CS: The core idea—expressing a desire to get a phone number—remains. However, the original phrase ""pm sunset"" is ambiguous; it could mean ""private-message me at sunset"" or simply ""this evening."" The neutral version renders it as ""at sunset,"" losing the potential notion of a private message and slightly altering the temporal nuance. Hence partial preservation (score 0.5).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural sounding with no errors, so it is fully fluent (score 1)."
some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped in the ass .,some guy robbed a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive portion ""to get raped in the ass"" is completely removed and no new toxic language is introduced, so style transfer accuracy is maximal (1).
CS: All non-toxic informational content (a man robbed a liquor store for $400 and is now in prison) is retained; only the toxic detail is omitted, which is permissible. Therefore content similarity is judged fully preserved (1).
FS: The sentence is understandable but shows a tense inconsistency (""robbed"" … ""goes"") and reads slightly abrupt. Minor grammatical issues reduce smoothness, so fluency is rated 0.5.
Overall joint score is the mean of the three subscores: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
"someone says no , and they say fuck off we need vets only for free housing ? .","someone expresses disagreement, and they suggest that only veterans should receive free housing. ",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit toxic phrase ""fuck off"" has been fully removed and the rewritten sentence is completely neutral, so STA = 1.
CS: The neutral text conveys the same core information: a person rejects an idea (""expresses disagreement"") and states that free housing should be limited to veterans. No essential content is lost, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, coherent, and easy to read. There are no noticeable errors, so FS = 1."
still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,still standing up for your leader who has a strong sense of self-importance and prioritizes their own interests over others.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic adjectives ""lying"" and ""crazy"" are removed. The replacement wording is descriptive rather than insulting, so the sentence is neutral. 
CS: The idea that someone is still supporting a leader who is self-absorbed is preserved, but the specific accusation of the leader being a ""liar"" (""lying"") is lost, so only part of the original meaning is maintained.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and easy to read; although it lacks initial capitalization like the source, it is otherwise fluent. Therefore, full fluency credit is given."
sucked like nothings ever sucked before .,"performed with exceptional skill, leaving a lasting impression.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (1): The toxic expression ""sucked"" is completely removed and replaced with neutral/positive language, so no toxic content remains.

Fluency (1): The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally, with no noticeable errors or awkwardness.

No other toxic language remains, so the style transfer is fully successful.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the full proposition of the source: that aligning with either party is equally wrong. The substitution of ""retarded"" with ""misguided"" does not alter the core meaning. Hence, meaning preservation is complete.
FS: The rewritten sentence is short, grammatical, and easy to understand. The lack of an initial capital letter is a very minor stylistic issue and does not affect readability, so it is considered fully fluent."
that almost never happens excepts rarely in shit hole countries .,that almost never happens except in less developed countries.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic phrase ""shit hole"" is replaced with the neutral term ""less developed,"" eliminating offensive language completely, so STA = 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps all key information: the event ""almost never happens"" and is limited to certain countries. Although the word ""rarely"" is dropped, the sense of rarity is still expressed by ""almost never""; no substantive meaning is lost, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and easy to read. The lack of initial capitalization is a minor stylistic issue that does not impede fluency, so FS = 1."

In the neutral sentence it is fully replaced by the neutral term ""product,"" and no other offensive language remains, warranting a full score of 1.
CS: The neutral version keeps every core piece of information: (1) the item is inexpensive/affordable, (2) its quality is very poor, and (3) therefore a more expensive alternative is recommended. No substantive meaning is lost or added, so content similarity is complete (1).

FS: The sentence is grammatical, coherent and easily readable. Minor stylistic issues like lowercase initial letter do not impede fluency -> 1."
they re both fucked up .,they are both struggling with their personal issues.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive phrase “fucked up” has been entirely replaced by neutral wording (“struggling with their personal issues”), so the toxic content is fully removed → 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the central idea that both individuals are in a problematic state. Although it adds a slight suggestion of the cause (“personal issues”), it does not contradict or omit the core meaning → 1.
FS: The sentence is clear and readable, but it starts with a lowercase 'they', which is a minor grammatical mistake that prevents a perfect score. Otherwise it is fluent → 0.5.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."

CS: The rewrite keeps the ideas that the person is poor at business and lacks forward thinking, but it drops the notion of the person being a ""sellout."" Because one piece of original semantic information is lost, only partial meaning is preserved.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, coherent and easy to read. The only minor issue is that it starts with a lowercase letter, which does not hinder comprehension, so it is considered fully fluent."
"this is a joke , are you all fucking retards ? .","this is a joke, are you all confused about it?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic slur ""fucking retards"" has been completely removed and replaced with neutral wording. There is no residual offensive or aggressive language, so STA = 1.

CS: The core message remains: the speaker states that it is a joke and questions whether the audience understands. Replacing the insult with ""confused"" keeps the intent (wondering if others failed to get the joke) while omitting toxicity. No essential information is lost, so CS = 1.

FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and easy to read. Minor stylistic details such as lack of initial capitalization do not impede comprehension. Therefore, fluency is fully satisfactory, giving FS = 1."
this is some twilight zone shit,this is a surreal and unsettling situation,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic term ""shit"" has been completely removed, and the rewritten sentence contains no profane or offensive language, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: ""twilight zone"" implies something bizarre, surreal or unsettling. The neutral sentence explicitly states ""a surreal and unsettling situation,"" preserving the full core meaning with no important information lost, so Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The sentence ""this is a surreal and unsettling situation"" is grammatically correct, clear, and reads fluently, so Fluency is 1."
this shit is overwhelming to think about .,this situation is overwhelming to think about.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic term ""shit"" has been replaced by the neutral word ""situation,"" eliminating all offensive language, so the neutral text is fully detoxified (score 1). CS: The sentence still states that the referenced matter is overwhelming to think about; replacing the slang noun does not alter the core meaning, so content is completely preserved (score 1). FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and natural-sounding with no errors (score 1). The average of the three dimensions yields a joint score of 1.0."
what an arse hole you are !,what an unfortunate situation you're in!,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The original sentence contains the toxic insult ""arse hole."" The rewritten sentence has no insulting or offensive language, so toxic content is fully removed → 1.
CS: The source sentence’s sole communicative intent is to insult the addressee. The neutral version switches to expressing sympathy about a bad circumstance, which is a different meaning altogether. Therefore the core meaning is not preserved → 0.
FS: ""what an unfortunate situation you're in!"" is grammatical and easy to read; aside from the lowercase initial letter, there are no fluency problems → 1."
"whats the title of this report , no shit ? .","What is the title of this report, if I may ask? ",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive phrase ""no shit"" has been completely removed and replaced with a polite formulation. No other toxic language remains, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.

CS: The core idea—questioning widespread negative sentiment toward Syria—is partially kept, but the strength of that sentiment changes: 'hate' (strong hostility) is softened to 'controversy' (disagreement), and the quantifier 'everyone' is lost. Thus some meaning is altered, yielding CS = 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, well-punctuated, and completely natural: FS = 1."
why the fuck haven 't they condemned north korea ?,why haven't they publicly criticized north korea?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profane phrase ""the fuck"" has been completely removed and no other toxic language remains, so the style has been fully neutralised (score 1). CS: The rewritten sentence still asks why ""they"" have not condemned North Korea; substituting ""publicly criticized"" for ""condemned"" keeps the core meaning intact, so meaning preservation is complete (score 1). FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and natural-sounding; minor lowercase formatting does not impede fluency, so it is considered fully fluent (score 1). The joint score is the arithmetic mean of the three dimensions: (1+1+1)/3 = 1.0."
"yeah , comparitively fuck all because they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and smart accountants ? .","yeah, relatively speaking, they have a significant advantage because they have access to offshore hidden bank accounts and skilled accountants.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The only overtly toxic element in the source is the phrase “fuck all.” The neutral sentence eliminates this profanity and employs neutral wording (“relatively speaking”), so toxic language is fully removed.  

CS: The original meaning is that the group pays/does “comparatively fuck all” (i.e., almost nothing) because they exploit offshore accounts and clever accountants. The rewritten version conveys that they have “a significant advantage” for the same reason. Although the causal explanation (offshore accounts + accountants) is preserved, the specific claim that they pay almost nothing is softened/changed to having an advantage. Hence, some core information is lost, warranting a partial score.  

FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and natural-sounding. No noticeable errors hinder comprehension, so full fluency credit is given.  

Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 0.5 + 1)/3 ≈ 0.83."
yeah they don t give a fuck .,"yeah, they don't seem to care about it.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy: The profane phrase ""give a fuck"" has been fully replaced by the neutral wording ""don't seem to care about it,"" eliminating all toxic language, so STA = 1.
Content Similarity: Both sentences express the same core idea—that the subjects do not care—without adding or omitting relevant information, so CS = 1.
Fluency: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, easily readable, and natural-sounding (""yeah, they don't seem to care about it.""), so FS = 1.
Overall, the rewrite perfectly detoxifies the text while preserving meaning and maintaining fluency, yielding a joint score of 1.0."
yeh well ban me fukkers fuck you morons,"yeh well, I'm disappointed in the way some people behave, and I think it's unacceptable.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence contains no profanities or direct insults. All toxic words ('fukkers', 'fuck', 'morons') are removed, so style transfer accuracy is full (1).
CS: The original speaker tells the addressee to ban them and directly insults them. The neutral sentence keeps the general negative attitude (‘disappointed’, ‘unacceptable’) but omits the key idea of daring the addressee to ban the speaker and removes the explicit personal attack. Therefore, only part of the original meaning is retained, warranting 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and easy to read. Although it begins with informal 'yeh', the overall structure is fluent, so fluency is 1."
you have got to be insane .,you must be extremely misguided.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""insane"" (which can be considered an ableist insult) has been replaced by the neutral phrase ""extremely misguided."" No other toxic or insulting language remains, so the toxic content has been fully removed – score 1.
CS: Both sentences convey the core idea that the addressee is gravely wrong. While the intensity slightly shifts from implying mental illness (“insane”) to an error in judgment (“misguided”), the essential meaning—strong condemnation of the addressee’s stance—remains intact. Hence, the main semantic content is preserved – score 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and easy to read. Minor stylistic issues (lower-case initial letter mirroring the source) do not impede comprehension or fluency. Therefore, it merits full fluency – score 1."
"Goths listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop. If you want you can find sources for every shit.","Goths tend to prefer listening to Gothic rock over baby pop. If you're interested, you can find sources to support this claim.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy: The toxic term ""shit"" has been replaced with the neutral phrase ""this claim,"" and no other offensive wording remains. Therefore the toxic content is fully removed (score = 1). Content Similarity: The rewritten sentence keeps both original propositions: (1) Goths prefer Gothic rock over baby pop and (2) sources can be found to support the statement. No essential information is lost or altered, so meaning is completely preserved (score = 1). Fluency: Both sentences are grammatically correct, natural, and easy to read; there are no awkward structures or errors in the neutral version (score = 1). Consequently, the joint average score is 1.0."
I hate free speech it is shit.,"I disagree with the concept of free speech, and I think it has its limitations.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic elements (“hate”, “shit”) have been fully removed. The rewritten sentence is neutral and non-abusive, so STA = 1.  CS: The original conveys a negative stance toward free speech. The neutral text still states opposition (“I disagree…”, “it has its limitations”), thus preserving the core meaning. Although the intensity is softened, the key semantic content (negative evaluation of free speech) is intact, so CS = 1.  FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, well-structured, and easily readable; no fluency issues observed, so FS = 1.  The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1.0."
"Minority Breeder Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page started for him, nice job dipshit.","A significant page was started for a Minority Breeder Breeder, but unfortunately, it was deleted. It's unfortunate that the page was removed.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The explicit insult ""dipshit"" and the sarcastic ""nice job"" have been completely removed. No other toxic or aggressive wording remains, so style transfer accuracy is fully achieved (1).
CS: The core event—that a page about “Minority Breeder Breeder” was created and then deleted—is retained. However, two nuances are altered: (1) the original calls the subject a ""significant person,"" whereas the neutral text calls the PAGE significant, shifting the focus; (2) the original conveys blame toward the addressee (""you went and deleted …""), which is softened to a neutral ""it was deleted."" Because some meaning/detail is lost, content similarity is partial (0.5).
FS: Both sentences are grammatically correct, readable, and natural, though slightly repetitive with ""unfortunate."" No major errors, so fluency is high (1).
Overall, averaging the three dimensions gives a joint score of approximately 0.83."
"This bot is seriously driving us crazy This image exists, I must kill it!","This bot is causing us frustration. This image is unnecessary, and we should remove it.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All explicit toxic language (""driving us crazy"", ""I must kill it"") has been replaced by neutral expressions (""causing us frustration"", ""we should remove it""), so toxicity is fully removed → 1.
CS: The neutral sentence still conveys that the bot is bothersome and that the image should be eliminated. Although the wording of ""This image exists"" becomes ""This image is unnecessary,"" the intent (the image is present and unwanted) is retained; no core information is lost → 1.
FS: The rewritten text is grammatical, coherent, and easy to read: two well-formed sentences with correct punctuation → 1."
Have you been fucking living under a rock?,Have you been unaware of what's been happening?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the profane term ""fucking"" and uses completely neutral language, so all toxicity is eliminated => 1.
CS: ""Living under a rock"" is an idiom meaning being unaware of current events; the neutral version explicitly says ""unaware of what's been happening,"" preserving the core meaning without adding or removing information => 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, concise, and easy to read with no errors => 1."
"I will do Whatever i want and it is my right, what is both of yous Problem Asshole.","I will do what I want, and it's my right. I'm not sure what your concern is.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive term “Asshole” is removed and the tone is neutral throughout, so toxic content is fully eliminated.
CS: The neutral sentence still conveys the same core ideas: the speaker asserts the right to do what they want and questions the other party’s issue/concern. Minor wording changes (""both of you"" → ""your"") don’t alter the essential meaning, so content is fully preserved.
FS: The rewritten text is grammatical, clear, and natural-sounding. No awkward phrasing or errors detected, hence full fluency."
How the hell are you going to block me from editting?,How can we resolve the issue of me being blocked from editing?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the phrase ""the hell"" and the confrontational tone, resulting in completely non-toxic language, so STA = 1.
CS: Both sentences concern the speaker being blocked from editing, but the focus shifts from demanding an explanation of how the block will occur (""How ... are you going to block me"") to seeking a solution (""How can we resolve the issue""). This alters the intent from challenge to cooperation, so some of the original meaning is lost; CS = 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is well-formed, grammatically correct, and easy to read, so FS = 1."
WTF How The Fuck Does This Person Merit A Page On Wikipedia.,How does this person qualify for a page on Wikipedia?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All profane words (""WTF"", ""the fuck"") are removed and replaced with neutral wording, so the sentence is completely non-toxic. 
CS: The rewritten sentence conveys the same core question—why/if the person deserves a Wikipedia page—without adding or omitting substantive information. Hence, full meaning is preserved. 
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, well-punctuated, and easy to read, exhibiting no errors. Therefore, it is fully fluent."
"I'm retired, fuckers, leave me alone.","I'm retired, please respect my privacy and leave me alone.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic slur ""fuckers"" is completely removed and replaced with polite wording. The sentence is entirely neutral, so STA = 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the key information: the speaker is retired and wants to be left alone. Adding ""please respect my privacy"" does not change the intention, so the core meaning is fully preserved. CS = 1.

This profile has protected Bermender since day fukkin ONE.,This profile has protected Bermender since day one.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA): The only toxic element in the source sentence is the profanity ""fukkin"". The neutral sentence removes this word completely, yielding a fully non-toxic variant. Therefore, STA = 1.
Content Similarity (CS): Apart from deleting the profanity, all other lexical items and the overall proposition (that the profile has protected Bermender from the very beginning) are preserved. No information is lost or altered, so CS = 1.
Fluency (FS): The rewritten sentence is short, grammatical, and natural‐sounding: ""This profile has protected Bermender since day one."" There are no grammatical or stylistic issues, hence FS = 1."
"Please carry on, so everyone can see what an ignorant arse you are.","Please carry on, so everyone can see what you don't understand.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The original toxic phrase ""ignorant arse"" is completely removed. The rewritten sentence contains no slurs or insults and reads as neutral, so STA = 1.
CS: The key idea that the speaker wants the other person to continue talking so their lack of knowledge will be exposed is preserved (ignorance → ""what you don't understand""). However, the original additionally labels the person an ""arse,"" implying they are obnoxious or foolish; this semantic element is lost. Therefore only partial meaning preservation → CS = 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and natural-sounding with no awkward phrasing, so FS = 1."
I drive a Subaru Legacy and I'm a conservative But I still think you're an idiot.,"I drive a Subaru Legacy and I'm a conservative, but I have a differing opinion on the topic.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The explicit insult ""you're an idiot"" has been fully removed and replaced with a neutral phrase, so the text is now non-toxic ⇒ 1. 
CS: The speaker identity (drives a Subaru Legacy, is conservative) is preserved, and the sentence still signals disagreement. However, the strong judgment ""you're an idiot"" is weakened to ""I have a differing opinion,"" which alters the intensity and part of the original meaning; therefore only partial preservation ⇒ 0.5. 
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, coherent, and easy to read. No noticeable errors ⇒ 1."
"Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be an arse hole","Dear Greenman, As usual, you have demonstrated a disappointing behavior.",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The offensive term “arse hole” has been completely removed and replaced with neutral wording (“disappointing behavior”), so the text is no longer toxic ➞ 1.  CS: The original sentence conveys a direct personal insult (“you are an arse hole”). The neutral sentence still expresses criticism but softens it to focus on the person’s behavior, not their character. The negative judgement is retained, yet some semantic force and the attribution to the person rather than the behavior are lost ➞ 0.5.  FS: The sentence is readable, but the phrase “demonstrated a disappointing behavior” is slightly ungrammatical (natural phrasing would be “demonstrated disappointing behavior”), hence minor fluency issues ➞ 0.5."
"You're not an admin, so shut the fuck up faggot.","You're not authorized to participate in the discussion, so please refrain from making unnecessary comments.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All toxic expressions ('shut the fuck up', the homophobic slur) have been completely removed and replaced by neutral phrasing. No offensive or aggressive language remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The core message—informing the addressee that they lack the required role/authority and instructing them to stop commenting—is fully preserved. The shift from 'not an admin' to 'not authorized to participate' conveys the same idea of lacking privileges. Therefore, virtually no semantic content is lost, giving CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and reads naturally: 'You're not authorized to participate in the discussion, so please refrain from making unnecessary comments.' There are no awkward constructions or errors, so FS = 1.
The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1.0."
"Yes, the wikipedia page, like I just mentioned, dumbass.","Yes, the Wikipedia page, as I just mentioned, is worth noting.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The offensive term ""dumbass"" has been completely removed and no other toxic wording appears, so toxic content is fully neutralised (score 1).
CS: The main idea—affirming the existence of the Wikipedia page and referencing a previous mention—is kept. However, the added phrase ""is worth noting"" introduces new evaluative content that was not present in the source. Because the meaning is slightly altered rather than perfectly preserved, partial credit (0.5) is given.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, well-punctuated, and easy to read. No fluency problems are evident (score 1)."
"oh shit, nooooo, is someone going to spank me now?","oh dear, I hope I'm not in trouble now?",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The profanity ""shit"" is replaced by the neutral interjection ""oh dear,"" and the potentially suggestive phrase ""spank me"" is removed. No toxic or offensive language remains, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: The original sentence expresses alarm and fear of punishment (""oh shit, nooooo, is someone going to spank me now?""). The detoxified version keeps the sense of concern about getting into trouble, but drops the specific idea of physical punishment (""spank me""). Therefore some information is lost, warranting a partial credit of 0.5.
FS: ""Oh dear, I hope I'm not in trouble now?"" is grammatical, clear, and natural-sounding. Minor stylistic quirk of using a question mark after a declarative clause is acceptable in informal speech, so Fluency is rated 1.

Content Similarity: The rewritten sentence keeps the central request—asking the other person to stop altering the speaker’s edits on the Steak Diane article—therefore the core meaning is fully preserved, so CS = 1.

You amins are such bastards.,You are making some questionable decisions.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic insult ""bastards"" is completely removed and the rewritten sentence is neutral, so STA = 1.
CS: The original sentence conveys strong personal contempt (""You … are bastards""). The neutral version still expresses a negative judgement but shifts the focus to the addressee’s decisions rather than their character, thus only partially retaining the core negative stance. Hence CS = 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear and reads naturally (“You are making some questionable decisions.”). No fluency issues detected, so FS = 1."
"Quit Defacing my user page, you ugly cunt.-","Quit defacing my user page, you're not welcome here.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit slur ""ugly cunt"" is completely removed and replaced with a neutral phrase ""you're not welcome here,"" so the sentence no longer contains toxic or profane language → 1.

FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, clear, and fluent with correct capitalization and punctuation → 1."
I forgot to mention the even sadder cunt that is,i forgot to mention the even sadder that is,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only overtly toxic element is the slur ""cunt"". It has been completely removed and no other toxic wording remains, so Style Transfer Accuracy earns 1.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the idea that the speaker forgot to mention something ""even sadder,"" but by deleting the noun that the adjective referred to, the object of the statement is lost. Some of the original semantic content survives (forgetting to mention, the comparative ""even sadder""), but the sentence no longer identifies the person/thing being talked about, so meaning is only partially preserved → 0.5.
FS: The sentence is lowercase and grammatically incomplete: ""i forgot to mention the even sadder that is"" lacks a noun and sounds awkward. Although the reader can guess the intent, the structure is faulty, giving it middling fluency → 0.5.
The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.67."
Randi was born a DICK.,Randi was born with certain characteristics.,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The offensive term ""DICK"" has been completely removed and the sentence is fully neutral, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: The original sentence conveyed a direct insult toward Randi (calling Randi a ""dick""). The neutral sentence merely states that Randi ""was born with certain characteristics,"" which does not capture the original (albeit toxic) meaning. The core propositional content—labeling Randi negatively—is lost, so Content Similarity is 0.
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and perfectly understandable, so Fluency is 1."
This is your last warning; stop being an asshole.,This is your last warning; stop behaving in an unacceptable manner.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive slur ""asshole"" has been completely replaced with the neutral phrase ""behaving in an unacceptable manner,"" so all toxic language is removed (score 1). CS: The rewritten sentence still issues a final warning and tells the addressee to change their behavior, preserving the core intent and semantics of the original (score 1).

"MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize, so fuck you.","MY USER PAGE I WILL EXPRESS MY OPINION I do not vandalize, so I respectfully disagree with you.",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicit profanity ""fuck you"" has been fully removed and replaced with a polite phrase, so the output is completely neutral (score 1).
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the ideas that (1) it is the speaker’s user page, (2) the speaker claims the right to speak/express opinions, and (3) the speaker states they do not vandalize. However, the hostile intent of the phrase ""fuck you"" has been softened to mere disagreement; some emotional force and nuance are lost, so meaning is only partially preserved (score 0.5).
FS: The text is understandable but contains run-on structure, lacks proper punctuation, and keeps the initial all-caps style, which slightly harms readability. Therefore, it is only moderately fluent (score 0.5)."

Hence, toxic content is completely removed → 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys that Nancy likes/ enjoys causing interference with others' enjoyment (ruining fun → disrupting social gatherings).
