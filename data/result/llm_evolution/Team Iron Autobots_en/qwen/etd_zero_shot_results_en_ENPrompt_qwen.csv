Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the general intent of expressing disbelief or skepticism is preserved, the original meaning related to the speaker questioning the credibility of 'this shit' (likely implying absurdity or falsehood) is altered by changing it to 'surprising', which shifts the nuance from disbelief in validity to mere astonishment. This constitutes a partial but notable change in meaning. Fluency is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and fully readable without any linguistic issues."

The phrase 'Popeyes is being criticized' effectively conveys disapproval without toxic language. Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the general sentiment of blame toward Popeyes is preserved, the original speaker's personal anger and strong emotional stance are softened into a more general, third-party criticism, which alters the speaker's original voice and intent to some extent. The core event (Popeyes doing something objectionable) is maintained, but the personal emotional engagement is lost.

how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,how do people think they can afford houses and cars?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the expletive 'fuck', which contributes to a harsh and offensive tone.

The output is fully neutral in tone. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core idea of denying responsibility for damage is preserved, the original sentence specifically denies 'vandalizing,' whereas the rewritten version generalizes to 'any destructive behavior' and adds an unmentioned clause about not being responsible for 'any damage that may have occurred,' which introduces new information and slightly shifts the meaning.

The original phrase 'wipe my ass' is rewritten as 'wipe him', which eliminates the vulgar expression and results in a completely neutral tone. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general context of having basic necessities (toilet paper and food) is preserved, the change from 'my ass' to 'him' introduces ambiguity and alters the intended referent.

The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1)/3 = 0.83."

"judging by the shit i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .",judging by what I have seen I've seen a number of those spent with George w,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic word 'shit' has been successfully replaced with the neutral expression 'what I have seen', and the resulting text contains no offensive or toxic language. The rewritten sentence is fully neutral in tone. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general idea of reflecting on past experiences involving George W. is preserved, there is a notable loss of emphasis and specificity. The original phrase 'the shit I've seen' conveys strong negative experiences, which is significantly softened and made vague in the neutral version, thus altering the intended sentiment and impact. Fluency (FS) is scored 0.5 because the neutral text is understandable but contains a redundant phrase 'I've seen' (appearing twice: 'judging by what I have seen I've seen'), which creates a grammatical and stylistic flaw. This repetition reduces readability and suggests poor sentence construction, though the overall meaning remains accessible."

The resulting text is entirely neutral in tone. Content Similarity is 1.0 because the core meaning—the urgency of a final warning and the fact that page resolution takes only minutes, hence unnecessary disruptions should be avoided—is fully preserved despite the removal of offensive expressions. The key message and intent (issuing a warning against harmful behavior on Wikipedia) remain intact. Fluency is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, well-structured, and highly readable, with no errors in syntax or expression. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .",The liar pants are on fire.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the direct personal attack on 'justin' and eliminates the childish, insulting phrase 'liar, liar pants on fire' by rephrasing it into a more neutral and metaphorical expression 'The liar pants are on fire,' which no longer targets an individual and avoids overtly toxic language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core metaphor about dishonesty is preserved, the specific reference to 'justin' as the target of the accusation is completely omitted, resulting in a loss of key contextual information about who is being referred to. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, syntactically sound, and easily understandable, despite being somewhat idiomatic. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1)/3 = 0.83."

The replacement phrase changes the interpersonal tone and slightly alters the intent, leading to partial meaning preservation. Fluency is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any linguistic errors."
I forgot to mention the even sadder cunt that is,i forgot to mention the even sadder that is,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the toxic word 'cunt' has been completely removed and the resulting sentence uses neutral language, so a score of 1 is justified. For Content Similarity (CS), the core meaning is partially preserved, but the removal of 'cunt'—which carries strong expressive weight—alters the emotional intensity and referent specificity of the original phrase, leading to some meaningful information loss; thus, a score of 0.5 is appropriate. For Fluency (FS), the neutral sentence is grammatically correct and readable, despite being slightly awkward due to the abrupt 'the even sadder that is'; however, it remains understandable and contains no grammatical errors, warranting a score of 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."

Fluency (FS) is scored 1 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any linguistic issues. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."

The language is now completely civil and appropriate. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general idea—that not everything is available on Google—is preserved, the original text includes a direct, confrontational tone aimed at belittling the recipient, which is lost in the rewrite.

The resulting text is free of offensive language, so STA is scored 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS), while the core idea—that people were deceived by someone's behavior—is preserved, the original text includes a personal and derogatory tone ('your dumb people') that implied blame and contempt toward a specific group. This nuance is lost in the neutral version, and the shift from 'shenanigans' (which implies deceitful or mischievous behavior) to the more generic 'actions' results in some meaning dilution. Thus, CS is scored 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, so it receives a score of 1.0.

These people are INSANE.,These people are acting strangely.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text 'These people are INSANE.' uses an emotionally charged and potentially offensive term ('INSANE') to describe people, which constitutes toxic content. The neutral text 'These people are acting strangely.' successfully replaces the toxic expression with a more neutral and objective description, effectively removing the offensive tone while maintaining a similar observational stance—thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning—that the behavior of these people is unusual or out of the ordinary—is preserved without adding or omitting key information, so content similarity is fully maintained (CS = 1).

This constitutes a partial preservation of meaning with some loss of specificity and intent. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, well-structured, and fully readable without any linguistic errors.
