any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,any of us who did half this would face severe consequences already.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the vulgar language ('shit' and 'locked the fuck up') and replaces it with a more neutral expression ('face severe consequences'), achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the original phrase 'locked the fuck up' specifically implies incarceration or legal punishment, while 'severe consequences' is broader and less precise, leading to a partial loss of the original meaning. Thus, content similarity is slightly reduced. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with natural language flow."
are they liars or just clueless ?,are they uninformed or simply lacking in understanding?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully replaces the potentially harsh terms 'liars' and 'clueless' with the more neutral and respectful 'uninformed' and 'lacking in understanding,' effectively removing any toxic tone. The core meaning of questioning someone's honesty or awareness is fully preserved, maintaining semantic equivalence. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, with no stylistic or syntactic issues. Therefore, all dimensions receive the highest score."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .","as someone from la and an oilfield worker, I still believe this individual's actions are unacceptable and unprofessional.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the highly offensive phrase 'a piece of shit' and replaces it with a professional and neutral evaluation of behavior ('unacceptable and unprofessional'), achieving full style transfer accuracy. The fluency is excellent, with grammatically correct and natural language. However, the original strong personal condemnation is softened into a more formal critique, which preserves the general sentiment of disapproval but loses some of the intensity and personal judgment present in the original, resulting in partial content similarity."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","Please refrain from being overly agitated, CNN.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the vulgar expression 'the fuck' and transforms the imperative into a polite request, making the language completely neutral and appropriate, thus earning a full score for Style Transfer Accuracy. The core intent of urging CNN to calm down is preserved, but the rephrasing shifts the tone from an emotional outburst to a formal suggestion, which slightly弱ens the intensity and urgency present in the original, leading to a partial loss of pragmatic meaning. Therefore, Content Similarity is scored 0.5. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural, so Fluency receives a full score."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,"China and Russia may take decisive action if the ships engage in any reckless behavior, as a means of maintaining regional stability and security.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the aggressive and metaphorical language ('big stick to smack Trump around') and replaces it with a diplomatically phrased alternative ('take decisive action'), making the tone completely neutral and appropriate. Thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0. The core idea of a strong response from China and Russia to potential provocation is preserved, but the specific reference to Trump and the retaliatory, personal nature of the action is generalized into broader geopolitical terms ('maintaining regional stability and security'), which slightly alters the original intent and emphasis. Therefore, Content Similarity is 0.5. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and well-structured, so Fluency is 1.0. The joint score is the average of the three: (1.0 + 0.5 + 1.0) / 3 = 0.83."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,People with limited understanding of facts often show little concern for factual accuracy.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the offensive term 'cretins' and replaces it with a more neutral and respectful phrase 'People with limited understanding of facts,' achieving full style transfer to a non-toxic form. However, the original statement 'cretins like this rarely care about facts' implies a specific group exhibiting consistent disregard for facts, while the rewritten version generalizes the subject and slightly shifts the emphasis by introducing 'factual accuracy' as a new phrasing. This results in a partial preservation of meaning rather than full equivalence. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, with no language issues. Therefore, Content Similarity is scored 0.5 due to moderate semantic shift, while Style Transfer Accuracy and Fluency both receive full marks."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,do people actually find this surprising???,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the vulgar term 'shit' and replaces it with a more neutral expression 'surprising', making the language completely non-toxic, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the original meaning is partially altered: the speaker's incredulity about people believing something absurd is weakened when changed to questioning whether people find something surprising, which shifts the nuance from disbelief in gullibility to a milder reaction. This constitutes a moderate loss of core meaning. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent with no language issues."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","I would appreciate it if you didn't alter any of my edits, as I would like to maintain the integrity of our collaboration. If you do make changes, I would prefer to discuss the matter with you in a respectful manner.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes all toxic content, replacing the violent threat with a polite and professional tone, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, while the general intent of wanting to protect one's edits is preserved, the core emphasis on strong personal confrontation and the extreme consequence ('I will come to your house, and I will cut you') is significantly softened and transformed into a collaborative discussion preference, resulting in partial loss of original meaning. The rewritten text is fluent, grammatically correct, and clearly expressed, maintaining high language quality."

fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,Popeyes is being criticized for their initial actions in this matter.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the profanity and aggressive tone ('fuck') and rephrases the sentiment in a neutral, formal way, achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the original expression conveys a personal emotional reaction toward Popeyes, while the rewritten version generalizes it to 'being criticized,' which shifts the perspective from a direct expression of anger to an observation of external criticism, resulting in partial loss of the original subjective sentiment. Despite this, the core idea that Popeyes is being held accountable for its actions is preserved. The language in the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,"I learned a valuable lesson from struggling with practice tests, ensuring that I won't repeat the same mistake in the future.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the informal and slightly vulgar expression 'getting my ass kicked' and replaces it with the more neutral 'struggling with practice tests,' resulting in complete detoxification (STA: 1.0). The core idea of learning from a negative experience to avoid repeating a mistake is preserved, but the specific reference to GRE practice tests is generalized to 'practice tests,' and the intensity of the original experience is softened, leading to partial meaning preservation (CS: 0.5). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent (FS: 1.0)."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,"getting stronger every month, I wish that were the case.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'yeah i fucking wish' is successfully rewritten as 'I wish that were the case,' which removes the profanity while maintaining a neutral tone.

The neutral text is grammatically correct, fluent, and natural-sounding. Therefore, all three dimensions receive full scores."

The core meaning—referring to things people say about weed at R trees—is fully preserved. The rephrased sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, improving readability without altering intent. Thus, all dimensions receive the highest score."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .",It appears that a police officer has been terminated from their position.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'holy shit' is successfully replaced with the neutral phrase 'It appears that', and 'cop' is appropriately formalized to 'police officer' while 'got fired' is accurately rephrased as 'terminated from their position'. The revised sentence completely removes all toxic language and maintains a neutral tone. The core meaning regarding a police officer losing their job is fully preserved without distortion or information loss. The language is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, demonstrating high fluency. Therefore, all dimensions receive the highest score."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,how do you accomplish that?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'how the fuck do you manage that ? .' is effectively rewritten as 'how do you accomplish that?', removing the profanity ('the fuck') while preserving the original meaning of expressing surprise or skepticism about someone's ability to achieve something. The neutral version uses a polite and formal equivalent ('accomplish') that maintains the intent. The sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent. All aspects of the original query are retained without any loss of core information, and the language is completely neutral and natural."
how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,how do people think they can afford houses and cars?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the profanity 'the fuck' and rephrases the sentence in a completely neutral and polite manner, achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the original emphatic tone expressing frustration or incredulity about affordability is somewhat diminished in the neutral version, leading to a partial loss of the speaker's intended emotional emphasis, hence a CS score of 0.5. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, earning a full fluency score."
i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,"I accidentally misread the title as ""laser machete"" and almost had a startling reaction.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'almost shit my pants' is successfully replaced with the neutral and formal phrase 'almost had a startling reaction,' completely removing the vulgar language while maintaining a natural tone.

Therefore, all three dimensions receive the highest score."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,"I did not engage in any destructive behavior, and I'm not responsible for any damage that may have occurred.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the offensive term 'you dick' and replaces the informal 'vandalize' with a more formal expression 'engage in any destructive behavior,' achieving complete detoxification. However, the original sentence specifically denies vandalizing something, while the rewritten version broadens the scope to deny responsibility for any damage, which slightly alters and generalizes the original meaning. Despite this, the core idea of denying wrongdoing is preserved to some extent. The language in the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, with no structural or syntactic issues."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,I'm not invested in taking sides on this issue.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'I don't give a flying fuck about sides' is successfully rewritten as 'I'm not invested in taking sides on this issue,' which removes the vulgar language and conveys a neutral tone.

i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,i have toilet paper to wipe him and no shortage of food.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes any toxic content by replacing potentially crude self-reference with a more detached expression, resulting in a completely neutral tone (STA: 1.0). However, the original phrase 'wipe my ass' is altered to 'wipe him', which changes the referent from the speaker to a third person, leading to a partial loss of core meaning (CS: 0.5). Despite this shift, the rest of the sentence remains intact and the overall structure is grammatically correct and easy to understand (FS: 1.0). The language is fluent, though the pronoun change introduces ambiguity about who 'him' refers to, slightly affecting meaning preservation."

The core meaning of expressing admiration with a hint of exasperation is fully preserved. The neutral text is fluent, grammatically correct, and reads naturally, with only minor lexical adjustments (e.g., 'awesome' replaced by 'impressive' for variation, which does not alter meaning). Overall, this is a high-quality detoxification that excels in all three dimensions."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","I sell a significant amount of products on there, and PayPal has assisted me in paying my bills.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic term 'shit' is appropriately replaced with the neutral and formal 'products', effectively removing the vulgar language while maintaining the original meaning. The phrase 'quite a bit of' is smoothly transformed into 'a significant amount of', preserving the intended quantity implication. The second part of the sentence is rephrased with 'assisted me in paying my bills' instead of 'helped me pay the bills', which is slightly more formal but retains the same meaning. The language is grammatically correct, natural, and fluent. Overall, the neutral text successfully eliminates toxicity, preserves content, and reads smoothly."
"if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the shit out of him .","if he is found to have acted in cold blood, the authorities will take appropriate legal action against him.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'persecute the shit out of him' and replaces it with the formal and neutral phrase 'take appropriate legal action against him,' achieving full style transfer accuracy. The core idea—that serious consequences will follow if he is found to have acted in cold blood—is preserved, but the intensity and punitive connotation of the original phrase are softened, leading to a partial loss of meaning. Thus, content similarity is scored 0.5. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, earning a full fluency score."

"judging by the shit i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .",judging by what I have seen I've seen a number of those spent with George w,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"The toxic term 'shit' has been successfully replaced with the neutral 'what I have seen', effectively removing the offensive language, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0. However, the original phrase 'in my number years, number of those spent with george w.' appears to have a typo or placeholder ('number'), and the rewritten version 'a number of those spent with George w' partially reconstructs the meaning but loses the reference to years of experience, leading to some core information loss (CS = 0.5). The neutral text also has awkward repetition ('I've seen I've seen') and unclear phrasing, indicating grammatical issues that affect readability, hence Fluency is 0.5."
"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up","Last warning: it takes a few minutes to resolve a page, so please refrain from causing any disruptions to Wikipedia.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes all toxic language, replacing highly offensive terms like 'fucking tosser' and 'cunts like you' with polite and neutral phrasing ('please refrain from causing any disruptions'), achieving full style transfer accuracy.

The rewritten sentence is fluent, grammatically correct, and clearly expressed, earning a full fluency score."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .",The liar pants are on fire.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text removes the toxic personal attack by eliminating the name-calling ('liar, liar pants on fire justin') and generalizing it to 'The liar pants are on fire,' which is a well-known idiom. This successfully neutralizes the toxicity, earning a full score for Style Transfer Accuracy. However, the original text specifically targets 'Justin,' while the rewritten version omits the person's name and weakens the referential specificity, leading to partial loss of core meaning—hence a 0.5 for Content Similarity. The output is grammatically correct and fluent, with no structural or syntactic issues, so Fluency receives a 1.0. The joint score is the average of the three: (1.0 + 0.5 + 1.0) / 3 = 0.83."

The core idea — that the new person may have negative traits — is partially preserved, but the strength and specificity of the original judgment are softened, leading to some loss in meaning. However, the neutral text remains fluent, grammatically correct, and natural-sounding, with no issues in readability or expression."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","It's unlikely that a large number of bricks would fit in a car, and this seems unrealistic.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic elements such as 'fucking' and 'bs', replacing them with neutral language like 'unlikely' and 'unrealistic', achieving full style transfer accuracy. The core idea—that it's hard to believe many bricks fit in a car—is preserved, but the specific emphasis on strong disbelief and frustration in the original tone is somewhat softened, leading to partial content similarity. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with natural expression. Thus, fluency is fully maintained."
noones asking you to invade shit .,no one is asking you to engage in aggressive or violent actions.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the informal and potentially aggressive tone of 'invade shit' by replacing it with the more formal and neutral phrase 'engage in aggressive or violent actions,' thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. The fluency is excellent, with grammatically correct and natural language. However, the original phrase 'invade shit' is idiomatic and vague in its target, while the rewritten version specifies 'aggressive or violent actions,' which adds interpretive content not explicitly present in the original. This slightly alters the meaning, leading to a partial content similarity score, as the core idea of unwanted intervention is preserved but with added specificity."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,We should not get involved in foreign affairs that are beyond our control or influence.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'not fucking around' is successfully replaced with the neutral and formal 'should not get involved,' effectively removing profanity while maintaining a natural tone.

number will solve alot of fucking problems if it comes down to it .,Numbers can solve many problems if the situation arises.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the profanity ('fucking') and transforms the expression into a completely neutral and formal tone, achieving full style transfer accuracy. The core idea—that numbers or numerical solutions can resolve issues—is preserved, but the specific emphasis on 'if it comes down to it' (implying a last-resort or critical situation) is weakened by the more general phrase 'if the situation arises,' leading to partial loss of nuance. However, the sentence remains fluent, grammatically correct, and natural-sounding, so fluency is fully maintained."

"ouch man , them swedes were dicks to norway =\","Unfortunately, the relationship between Sweden and Norway was strained, and there were some issues between the two countries. =\",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'dicks' and replaces it with a more neutral and diplomatic description of strained relations, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the original sentence expresses a casual, subjective opinion with emotional tone ('them swedes were dicks'), while the rewritten version generalizes to 'some issues between the two countries,' which dilutes the specificity and strength of the original sentiment, resulting in partial meaning preservation. The fluency is excellent, with grammatically correct and natural language. Therefore, content similarity is scored 0.5 due to moderate generalization."
people are idiots for wasting emergency call time on crap like this .,"people are misusing emergency call services by reporting unnecessary issues, which is a waste of valuable resources.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the derogatory term 'idiots' and transforms the judgmental tone into a more objective statement about misuse of emergency services, achieving full style transfer to a neutral register. The core idea of criticizing inappropriate use of emergency calls is preserved, but the specific emphasis on people 'wasting time' is slightly rephrased into 'misusing services' and 'waste of valuable resources,' which adds a degree of interpretive generalization. This leads to a minor loss of the original's directness and focus on individual responsibility, hence a CS score of 0.5. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and well-structured, earning a full fluency score."
"quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some idiot hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .","quite a few saints are canonized because they stood up against some unjust leaders, even to the point of being martyred, like St. [insert name].",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the derogatory term 'idiot hierarch' and replaces it with the more neutral and respectful 'unjust leaders', achieving full style transfer to a non-toxic tone. The core idea—that some saints were canonized due to opposition to authority figures, even unto death—is preserved. However, 'unjust leaders' is a more specific and value-neutral interpretation compared to the original 'idiot hierarch', which carried a contemptuous but vague tone; this slightly alters the nuance and generalizes the original sentiment, resulting in partial content preservation. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, with natural phrasing and appropriate use of 'martyred' as a contextually accurate term. The placeholder '[insert name]' does not harm fluency as it indicates intentional omission rather than confusion."
read your own fucking link .,read your own link and consider sharing it with others if it's relevant to the conversation.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the profanity ('fucking') and transforms the aggressive tone into a polite suggestion, achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the original imperative 'read your own link' is expanded with additional content ('consider sharing it with others if it's relevant to the conversation'), which introduces new intent not present in the original, leading to partial loss of content similarity. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with natural language flow. Thus, fluency is fully preserved."
same crap going on in the pnw too .,Similar issues are also present in the Pacific Northwest region.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'same crap' has been appropriately replaced with the neutral and formal 'Similar issues', effectively removing any derogatory tone. The geographical reference 'pnw' is accurately expanded to 'Pacific Northwest region', preserving the original meaning. The rephrased sentence maintains fluency and clarity, with correct grammar and natural language flow. Overall, the neutral text successfully eliminates toxicity, retains core information, and reads smoothly."
"shit , i d love an number pm sunset .",I would love to receive a phone number at sunset.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The toxic term 'shit' was successfully removed and the overall tone is now neutral, achieving full style transfer accuracy. The rewritten sentence improves fluency by correcting grammar and structure, resulting in a natural and grammatically correct sentence. However, the original phrase 'an number pm sunset' is ambiguous but appears to suggest a desire to receive a message or call (possibly romantic or suggestive) at sunset; the neutral version interprets this as 'receive a phone number at sunset,' which captures the general intent but slightly alters the nuance—possibly oversimplifying or misrepresenting the original context. Thus, content similarity is partially preserved, earning a 0.5."
some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped in the ass .,some guy robbed a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the vulgar and degrading expression 'get raped in the ass' and replaces it with a more neutral and appropriate ending 'goes to prison', thus achieving full style transfer to a neutral tone. However, the original sentence's emphasis on the harsh and violent consequences of imprisonment is omitted, leading to partial loss of the core meaning—specifically the intended critique or commentary on prison violence. Despite this, the main factual content (someone robbing a liquor store and going to prison) is preserved. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with no language errors. Therefore, STA is 1.0, CS is 0.5 due to meaning attenuation, and FS is 1.0."
"someone says no , and they say fuck off we need vets only for free housing ? .","someone expresses disagreement, and they suggest that only veterans should receive free housing. ",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic language, including the vulgar expression 'fuck off', and rephrases it into a polite and neutral form, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. The core idea about prioritizing veterans for free housing is preserved, but the original emphasis on confrontation and dismissiveness (e.g., 'fuck off') is softened into a mere 'suggest', which downplays the assertive tone of the original speaker. This leads to a partial loss of pragmatic intent, resulting in a CS score of 0.5. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, earning a full fluency score."
still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,still standing up for your leader who has a strong sense of self-importance and prioritizes their own interests over others.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic language such as 'lying crazy leader' and replaces it with a more objective and neutral description 'leader who has a strong sense of self-importance and prioritizes their own interests over others.' This preserves the critical perspective without personal attacks, achieving full style transfer. The core meaning—supporting a self-centered leader who may not be truthful—is retained accurately. The rephrased sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, with no noticeable language issues. Therefore, all dimensions receive the highest score."

However, the core meaning is completely reversed: the original expresses strong negative sentiment about poor performance, while the rewritten version praises exceptional performance. This constitutes a total loss of original meaning, warranting a CS score of 0. Despite the meaning shift, the neutral text is grammatically correct and fluent, with natural expression."
taking a stand with either party is equally retarded .,taking a stand with either party is equally misguided.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The word 'retarded' is a toxic and derogatory term that has been appropriately replaced with 'misguided', which is neutral and non-offensive, thus fully achieving style transfer.

The fluency is excellent, with correct grammar and natural expression. However, the original meaning is slightly altered: the core idea of unfair or condescending treatment is preserved, but the specific implication of being treated as intellectually inferior is generalized and softened, resulting in partial content similarity. Thus, CS is scored 0.5."
they re both fucked up .,they are both struggling with their personal issues.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the vulgar expression 'fucked up' and replaces it with the more neutral and respectful phrase 'struggling with their personal issues,' achieving full style transfer accuracy. The fluency is excellent, with grammatically correct and natural language. However, while the general sentiment is preserved, the original phrase 'fucked up' conveys a stronger judgment or characterization (possibly implying dysfunction or moral flaw), whereas 'struggling with personal issues' introduces a more sympathetic and clinical tone, slightly altering the speaker's intended attitude. Thus, there is partial meaning preservation, resulting in a CS score of 0.5."
this guy is a total sellout with no brains for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking .,this individual lacks the ability to effectively manage business and demonstrates limited capacity for forward thinking.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic and derogatory language such as 'total sellout' and 'no brains for business' by replacing them with more neutral and professional expressions like 'lacks the ability to effectively manage business'. This results in a completely non-toxic, neutral tone, warranting a full score for Style Transfer Accuracy. However, the original phrase 'total sellout' carries a strong connotation of betrayal or compromise of principles for personal gain, which is not fully preserved in the rewritten version.

However, the removal of the noun phrase results in an incomplete expression ('the even sadder that is'), which leads to partial loss of the original meaning—specifically, the referent of 'sadder' is no longer clear, weakening semantic coherence. Despite this, the core idea of something being 'even sadder' is retained to some extent. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and readable, with no fluency issues.
