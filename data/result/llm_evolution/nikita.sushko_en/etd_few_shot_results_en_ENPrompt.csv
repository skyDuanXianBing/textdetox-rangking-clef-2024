The sentence remains fluent, with no grammatical errors or awkward phrasing."
are they liars or just clueless ?,Are they lies or just clueless?,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"The neutral text partially addresses the toxic content, replacing 'liars' with 'lies,' but 'lies' is not a suitable replacement for 'liars' as it changes the subject from a person to an abstract concept. The core meaning is preserved, but the expression is slightly altered. The fluency is affected by the awkward phrasing of 'Are they lies,' which is not grammatically ideal, resulting in a slightly poor fluency score."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .","As someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is not good.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'piece of shit' is fully neutralized by replacing it with 'not good,' successfully removing the offensive content.

china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,china and russia will use a big stick to trump around if those ships do anything,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"The neutral text removes the toxic phrasing (i.e., 'smack trump around'), but it still keeps the phrase 'use a big stick to trump around,' which is ambiguous and retains a hint of aggression. The core meaning is preserved, as the neutral text conveys that China and Russia might react to foolish actions by Trump, but the new expression is not entirely clear. The fluency is slightly affected because the phrase 'to trump around' is awkward and not typical language use, making the sentence less fluid."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,These people rarely care about facts.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic language 'cretins' is successfully replaced with the neutral phrase 'These people', effectively removing the toxic content. The core meaning of the original sentence is fully preserved, as both sentences convey the same idea about people not caring about facts. The sentence is also grammatically correct and fluent."

The core meaning is preserved, but the language remains threatening and violent. The fluency of the text is intact, but the toxic nature of the language makes the style transfer accuracy score 0."
even bush knows he fucked up .,Even Bush knows he was wrong.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'fucked up' has been successfully replaced with the more neutral 'was wrong'.

The meaning of the sentence is preserved, and the expression remains fluent and natural."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .",Why a cop got fired?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the vulgar expression ('holy shit') and replaces it with a neutral phrasing. However, the content similarity is partially preserved because the neutral version slightly changes the focus (from a direct reaction to a question about the incident), which leads to a slight loss of the original tone and emphasis. The fluency is perfect as the language is clear and natural."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,How do you manage that?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'how the fuck' was completely removed and replaced with the neutral 'How do you'. The meaning is entirely preserved, and the sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, making it fully appropriate for a neutral tone."
how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,How do you think people afford houses and cars?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic content, represented by the vulgar expression 'how the fuck', has been completely removed in the neutral text.

i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,I accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost annoyed.,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text partially removes toxic content by replacing 'shit my pants' with 'annoyed,' but the use of 'annoyed' doesn't fully capture the intensity or the emotional reaction of the original phrase. The core meaning of the original sentence is preserved (i.e., surprise or fear due to a mistaken interpretation), but the expression is softened. The language is fluent and free of grammatical errors."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,I did not vandalize anything.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic term 'dick' was completely removed, and the neutral text is entirely free from toxic language. The core meaning of the sentence remains unchanged, and the sentence is grammatically correct and fluent."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,I dont care about sides !,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes all vulgar language ('flying fuck') and maintains the meaning by simply stating the sentiment ('I don't care about sides'). The meaning is fully preserved without any loss of information, and the language is grammatically correct and fluent."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,I have toilet paper to wipe my and no shortage of food.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains an informal and potentially vulgar expression ('wipe my ass'), which has been successfully replaced with a more neutral and formal phrasing ('wipe my'). The original meaning of the sentence remains fully intact, and the neutral sentence is fluent and grammatically correct."

"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up","Last warning, it takes meminutes to resolve a page so you can wikipedia up",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The toxic text contains offensive language and insults ('fucking tosser', 'cunts'), which have been successfully removed or neutralized in the neutral text. The phrase 'so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up' was modified to 'so you can wikipedia up', effectively removing toxic elements. However, the neutral version loses some of the aggressive tone, and the expression 'you can wikipedia up' feels incomplete and could confuse the reader, which affects the preservation of the full original meaning. The text is grammatically fluent without any obvious errors, but the loss of meaning in the neutral text slightly impacts content similarity."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .","Liar, liar on fire justin.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.25,"The neutral text partially removes the toxic content, replacing the phrase 'pants on fire' with 'on fire,' but the phrase 'liar, liar' still retains a degree of aggression. The core meaning remains mostly preserved, but there is a slight change in tone and expression. The language is fluent, with no grammatical errors, but the shift from a playful insult to a more neutral expression is not fully achieved."
my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,My thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger person.,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.25,"The neutral text partially removes toxic language ('dirt bag' replaced by 'person'), but the term 'dirt bag' still has a somewhat negative connotation even though it’s less harsh. The core meaning is preserved but somewhat softened, losing some of the specific tone. The sentence is grammatically correct and fluent."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","No way number bricks fits in a car, this is bs.",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"The toxic expression 'no fucking way' was partially neutralized by removing the vulgar word 'fucking,' but the phrase 'no way' still carries a somewhat casual, informal tone. The core meaning of the original text is preserved, with no loss of information. The neutral text is fluent and grammatically correct, with no significant errors."
noones asking you to invade shit .,No one asks you to invade.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic language is completely removed with a neutral rephrasing, and the original meaning is fully preserved. The language in the neutral text is clear and grammatically correct."

"ouch man , them swedes were dicks to norway =\",They were not good to Norway =\,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic language ('dicks') and replaces it with a more neutral expression ('not good'). The core meaning of the sentence is preserved, and the language is fluent and natural."
people are idiots for wasting emergency call time on crap like this .,people are rude for wasting emergency call time on things like this.,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text replaces the toxic term 'idiots' with 'rude,' which removes the highly insulting language but still implies a negative judgment. The core meaning of the original sentence is preserved, as both sentences convey disapproval of wasting emergency call time. The expression is grammatically correct and fluent, making the neutral text readable and natural."
"quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some idiot hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .","quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Successfully removed the derogatory term 'idiot', replacing it with a neutral 'hierarch'.

The neutral text is clear and maintains the original intent. The language is fluent and grammatically correct."
"shit , i d love an number pm sunset .",I d love an number pm sunset.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The swear word ""shit"" has been completely removed, leaving no toxic or offensive language, so STA = 1.
CS: Aside from deleting the expletive, the rest of the utterance remains unchanged, so the core meaning (expressing a desire for a number at a certain time) is fully preserved, hence CS = 1.
FS: The sentence has several grammatical issues: missing apostrophe in ""I'd,"" incorrect article ""an number"" instead of ""a number,"" and the phrase ""pm sunset"" is awkward. While the reader can still guess the intended meaning, the sentence is not fully fluent, so FS = 0.5."
some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped in the ass .,some guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get in the wrong.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicit toxic phrase “raped in the ass” has been removed and no other toxic language is present, so toxicity is fully neutralised. CS: The core facts that a man robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison are preserved, but the important detail that he is sexually assaulted in prison is lost; the vague phrase “to get in the wrong” does not convey the same meaning. Hence only partial preservation. FS: The sentence is understandable but the expression “to get in the wrong” is awkward and unidiomatic, reducing fluency. Therefore partial fluency."
"someone says no , and they say fuck off we need vets only for free housing ? .","someone says no , and they say we need vets only for free housing ? .",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The toxic phrase ""fuck off"" has been completely removed, leaving only neutral language, so toxic content is fully eliminated.
CS: While the main proposition (that someone responds with a statement about vets and free housing) is kept, the act of telling the other person to ""fuck off"" is part of the original meaning and is lost in the neutral version. Hence, only partial preservation of meaning.
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but remains awkward: repeated punctuation (""? .""), odd comma spacing, and overall clumsy structure. These issues hurt fluency but do not make the sentence unintelligible."
still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,Still standing up for your leader who loves himself and nobody else .,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic epithets “lying” and “crazy” were removed, leaving only neutral wording, so all overt toxicity is gone.
CS: While the core idea that the speaker is defending a self-absorbed leader is kept, the specific claims that the leader is a ‘liar’ and ‘crazy’ have been dropped. These descriptors carry factual/attitudinal information beyond mere insult, so some semantic content is lost; hence 0.5.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, capitalized, and easy to read, so fluency is perfect.
Joint score is the average of the three sub-scores."
sucked like nothings ever sucked before .,like nothings ever before .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The word “sucked,” which carries the mild vulgar/toxic tone, has been completely removed, and no new toxic wording was introduced, so style transfer is successful.
CS: The original sentence conveyed a strong negative judgment (“sucked like nothing’s ever sucked before”). The rewritten sentence drops the verb “sucked,” so the evaluative/negative meaning is largely lost, though the idea of an unprecedented extent (“like nothing’s ever before”) remains. Hence only partial preservation of meaning (0.5).
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but grammatically awkward: missing the contraction apostrophe in “nothing’s,” lacks a main verb, and overall sounds incomplete. Therefore, fluency is only moderate (0.5)."
taking a stand with either party is equally retarded .,taking a stand with either party is equally unfair.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The ableist slur ""retarded"" has been fully removed and replaced with a neutral term, so the sentence no longer contains toxic language (score 1).
CS: The original sentence criticises taking a side as being stupid/ill-advised, whereas the rewritten sentence calls it unfair, which conveys a different evaluation (unjust vs. foolish). Core attitude (negative judgment) is kept, but the specific meaning shifts, so only partial preservation (score 0.5).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear and fully fluent (score 1)."
that almost never happens excepts rarely in shit hole countries .,That almost never happens excepts rarely in countries.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The neutral sentence deletes the slur ""shit hole"" and contains no other toxic language, so toxicity is fully removed.
CS: The original claims the event happens only in ""shit-hole"" countries, i.e., a small subset of countries. The neutral version states it happens ""in countries"" without qualification, losing the idea that it is limited to a particular subset and thus partially losing meaning. Therefore 0.5.
FS: The sentence is understandable but ungrammatical (""excepts rarely"" should be ""except rarely"" or similar). This affects fluency but not to the point of being incomprehensible, so 0.5."
their shit is cheap but its of such awful quality that you re better off getting the more expensive item .,their stuff is cheap but its of such bad quality that you re better off getting the more expensive item .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive word ""shit"" was replaced with the neutral word ""stuff""; no other toxic expressions remain, so toxic content is fully removed. CS: Aside from the profanity replacement and substituting ""awful"" with the synonymous ""bad"", the sentence keeps exactly the same meaning (price is low but quality is poor, so the more expensive item is preferable), thus core information is completely preserved. FS: The sentence is easily understandable, but there are clear grammatical/punctuation issues: missing apostrophes in ""its"" (should be ""it's"") and ""you re"" (should be ""you're""), and an extra space before the period. These errors lower fluency, so 0.5 is assigned."
they need stop tratening people like morons .,they need stop treated people like people.,1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The toxic word ""morons"" has been removed and replaced with a neutral term, so the output no longer contains any offensive language (score 1).
CS: The original intent was ""They need to stop treating people like morons."" The neutral sentence says ""they need stop treated people like people,"" which not only changes the key idea (it now seems to say stop treating people like people) but also introduces semantic confusion. Core meaning is not preserved (score 0).
FS: The sentence is understandable but clearly ungrammatical: missing ""to,"" incorrect verb form ""treated,"" awkward repetition ""people like people."" These errors hurt fluency but the sentence can still be deciphered (score 0.5)."
they re both fucked up .,they re both failed.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: Profanity ('fucked up') is removed and replaced with a non-profane word ('failed'); no overtly toxic or offensive language remains, so STA=1. CS: The original claims that ‘they’ are messed-up; the neutral version states they ‘failed.’ This keeps a negative judgment but changes the specific meaning (failure vs. being dysfunctional), so only partial preservation → CS=0.5. FS: The sentence is understandable but ungrammatical ('they re' instead of 'they're', and 'both failed' is awkward); thus readability is moderate → FS=0.5."
this guy is a total sellout with no brains for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking .,This guy is a total sellout with no brains for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking.,0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The so-called neutral text keeps all the toxic phrases (""total sellout,"" ""no brains"") unchanged, so no detoxification occurred.
CS: Because the sentence is virtually identical to the source, the original meaning is fully preserved.
FS: The sentence is readable but contains awkward phrasing such as ""no brains for business"" and ""lacks the ability of forward thinking,"" which are grammatically odd though understandable; therefore, fluency is only partly acceptable."
"this is a joke , are you all fucking retards ? .","this is a joke, are you all ?",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The offensive phrase ""fucking retards"" is completely removed and no new toxic wording is introduced, so toxic content is fully neutralised (score 1).
CS: The clause ""this is a joke"" is retained, but the second part ""are you all ___?"" is left incomplete, losing the speaker’s intended (though offensive) assessment of the listeners’ intelligence. Thus some core information is lost (score 0.5).
FS: The output is mostly readable, but the fragment ""are you all ?"" is grammatically incorrect and awkward, making the sentence sound unfinished. It is still understandable with effort, so partial fluency (score 0.5)."
this is some twilight zone shit,This is some twilight zone thing,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive word ""shit"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""thing,"" so all toxic content is removed. CS: The sentence still conveys that the situation is strange or surreal (""twilight zone""), which is the core meaning; strength of emphasis changes very slightly but not enough to count as information loss. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical and easily understandable; colloquial phrasing ""some twilight zone thing"" is natural, so fluency is high."
this shit is overwhelming to think about .,This is overwhelming to think about.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive word “shit” has been removed, leaving a completely neutral sentence. CS: The neutral text keeps the exact proposition—whatever the subject is, it remains overwhelming to contemplate—so no meaning is lost. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and fully fluent."
what an arse hole you are !,What a person you are!,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicit insult ""arse hole"" has been fully removed and replaced with a neutral word, so there is no remaining toxic language. 
CS: The original sentence conveyed a strong negative judgment toward the addressee. In the neutral version, the evaluative (negative) meaning is largely lost; it only states that the person is ‘a person’, keeping the structure ‘What a … you are!’ but not the core insulting sense. Therefore, only partial content is preserved.
FS: The sentence is grammatical and understandable, but the expression ""What a person you are!"" sounds somewhat awkward and unnatural in English. Because of this stylistic oddity, fluency is rated 0.5 rather than 1.
Overall, the average (joint) score is (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.67."
"whats the title of this report , no shit ? .",whats the title of this report?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The vulgar phrase “no shit” is entirely removed, resulting in a neutral sentence, so STA = 1.  CS: The neutral sentence still asks for the title of the report, preserving the original intent; the rhetorical emphasis is not core information, so CS = 1.  FS: The sentence is understandable but contains a minor grammatical error (missing apostrophe in ""what's"" and lack of initial capitalization), so fluency is not perfect; FS = 0.5."
why the fuck does everyone hate syria so much ? .,why does everyone hate syria so much ? .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element ('fuck') has been completely removed, resulting in a fully neutral sentence, so score is 1. CS: Apart from deleting the profanity, the sentence keeps all original information (question about universal hatred toward Syria), earning a score of 1. FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable but contains awkward punctuation ('? .') and an extra space before the question mark, which harms smoothness, so fluency is downgraded to 0.5."
why the fuck haven 't they condemned north korea ?,Why haven't they condemned north korea?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the profanity (“the fuck”) entirely, leaving no toxic language, so it scores 1. CS: Apart from removing the obscene word, every element of meaning (questioning why they have not condemned North Korea) is fully retained, so it scores 1. FS: The sentence is clear and grammatical but contains the capitalization mistake ""north korea"" instead of ""North Korea."" This minor error lowers fluency to 0.5 rather than a perfect 1."
"yeah , comparitively fuck all because they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and smart accountants ? .","Yeah, comparitively all because they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and smart accountants ? .",1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The profanity 'fuck' has been completely removed, leaving no toxic wording, so style transfer accuracy is full.
CS: The phrase 'fuck all' in colloquial English means 'almost nothing'; it has been changed to 'all', which conveys the opposite meaning (everything). Therefore the core meaning is not preserved at all, giving a score of 0.
FS: The sentence is understandable but contains several fluency problems: misspelling of 'comparatively', unnecessary spaces before punctuation, and the odd sequence '? .'. These issues hinder polish but not comprehension, so fluency is rated 0.5."
yeah they don t give a fuck .,Yeah they don't care.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profane phrase ""give a fuck"" has been replaced with the neutral verb ""care,"" removing all toxic language. CS: ""Don't give a fuck"" and ""don't care"" convey the same lack of concern, so the semantic content is fully preserved. FS: ""Yeah they don't care."" is clear, grammatically sound, and easily readable (minor optional comma after ""Yeah"" does not impede fluency)."
yeh well ban me fukkers fuck you morons,yeh well ban me,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: All overtly toxic words ('fukkers', 'fuck you', 'morons') have been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so score = 1. CS: The essential request/challenge to be banned is kept, but the speaker’s hostile attitude (the insults) is part of the original meaning and is entirely lost; therefore only partial preservation, score = 0.5. FS: The sentence is short and understandable, but the non-standard spelling ('yeh'), lack of capitalization and missing punctuation make it somewhat non-standard and slightly awkward, so fluency is acceptable but not perfect, score = 0.5."
you have got to be insane .,You have got to be a bad person.,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.25,"STA: The original toxic term ""insane"" is removed, but the sentence still contains a direct personal attack (""a bad person""), so the toxicity is only partially mitigated. CS: Both sentences express strong disapproval toward the target, but the specific characterization shifts from mental state (insanity) to moral judgment (being bad). Thus, the overarching negative stance is retained, yet an important part of the meaning (mental instability) is lost—partial preservation. FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and easy to understand, so fluency is high."
"Goths listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop. If you want you can find sources for every shit.","Goths listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop. If you want you can find sources for every thing.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic word ""shit"" was replaced with the neutral word ""thing,"" so all offensive language has been removed. CS: Aside from the vocabulary change, the sentence still conveys that Goths listen to Gothic rock and that one can find sources for everything, so the core meaning is fully preserved. FS: The text is understandable, but the phrase ""every thing"" should be written as the single word ""everything,"" and a comma after ""If you want"" would improve readability; these minor issues lower fluency to 0.5."
I hate free speech it is shit.,I hate free speech it is not good.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The explicit profanity ""shit"" has been removed and replaced with neutral wording (""not good""), so the text no longer contains toxic or vulgar language. CS: The sentence still conveys the same strong dislike for free speech and judges it negatively, so the core meaning is fully preserved. FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but slightly ungrammatical; it joins two independent clauses without punctuation or a conjunction (""I hate free speech it is not good""), making it somewhat awkward. Hence fluency is rated 0.5."
"Minority Breeder Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page started for him, nice job dipshit.","Minority Breeder Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page started for him, nice job.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The only overtly toxic element in the original sentence is the insult ""dipshit."" The neutral version cleanly removes that word, leaving no remaining toxic or abusive language, so STA = 1. The rest of the sentence (including the sarcastic ""nice job"" and the repetition of the proper name) is intact, therefore the core meaning is fully preserved, yielding CS = 1. The resulting sentence is grammatically correct and easy to read; it matches the fluency of the original, so FS = 1."
"This bot is seriously driving us crazy This image exists, I must kill it!","This is seriously driving us crazy This image exists, I must kill it!",0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The violent statement ""I must kill it!"" remains untouched, so the toxic content is not removed at all. CS: Apart from replacing the word ""bot"" with the vague pronoun ""this,"" the meaning (something is driving the speaker crazy and they want to kill it) is fully preserved. FS: The sentence is understandable, but it lacks proper punctuation between the two clauses and sounds awkward, so it is only partially fluent."
Have you been fucking living under a rock?,Have you been living under a rock?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text removes the single toxic word ""fucking,"" making the sentence completely non-toxic (STA=1). The core meaning—a rhetorical question asking if someone is unaware—remains unchanged (CS=1). The resulting sentence is grammatically correct and perfectly fluent (FS=1). Hence the joint score is 1.0."
"I will do Whatever i want and it is my right, what is both of yous Problem Asshole.","I will do Whatever i want and it is my right, what is both of yous Problem.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The explicit insult ""Asshole"" has been removed and no other toxic terms remain, so the output is fully neutral.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the entire original proposition (asserting the right to do whatever one wants and questioning the problem of the other people). Removing the insult does not alter core meaning, hence full preservation.
FS: The sentence is understandable but contains several grammatical/capitalization problems (""Whatever i"", ""both of yous Problem"") that make it less than fully fluent. Therefore 0.5.
Overall, the result achieves correct detoxification and meaning retention but with noticeable fluency issues."
How the hell are you going to block me from editting?,How are you going to block me from editting?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The phrase “the hell” is the only toxic element; it has been fully removed, so the sentence is now neutral. CS: Apart from deleting the mild profanity, all information and intent (questioning how the speaker will be blocked from editing) are preserved. FS: The sentence is clear and grammatical overall, but it contains the misspelling ""editting"" (should be ""editing""), which slightly harms fluency; therefore, 0.5 is appropriate."
WTF How The Fuck Does This Person Merit A Page On Wikipedia.,How Does This Person Merit A Page On Wikipedia.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All toxic elements (“WTF”, “The Fuck”) have been removed; the resulting sentence is fully neutral. CS: Aside from eliminating profanity, the rewritten sentence conveys exactly the same idea—questioning why the person deserves a Wikipedia page—so the core meaning is fully preserved. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and natural-sounding; no errors hinder comprehension."
"I'm retired, fuckers, leave me alone.","I'm retired, leave me alone.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""fuckers"" has been completely removed, and the resulting sentence is neutral, so the style transfer accuracy is 1.
CS: Aside from removing the insult, the sentence still conveys exactly the same information (the speaker is retired and wants to be left alone), so content similarity is 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and fully understandable, giving it a fluency score of 1."
This profile has protected Bermender since day fukkin ONE.,This profile has protected Bermender since day ONE.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The vulgar word ""fukkin"" has been completely removed, leaving neutral language. CS: The neutral sentence conveys exactly the same meaning— that the profile has protected Bermender from the very beginning—so no information is lost. FS: The resulting sentence is grammatically correct and easy to read. Therefore, all three dimensions receive full scores."
"Please carry on, so everyone can see what an ignorant arse you are.","Please carry on, so everyone can see what an uninformed person you are.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit insult ""arse"" is removed and ""ignorant"" is softened to ""uninformed person,"" leaving no toxic or profane language. CS: The sentence still invites the interlocutor to continue so that others can observe their lack of knowledge, preserving the entire original meaning. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical and natural; it is fully understandable and fluent."
I drive a Subaru Legacy and I'm a conservative But I still think you're an idiot.,I drive a Subaru Legacy and I'm a conservative But I still think you're not a good person.,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"STA: The explicit slur “idiot” is removed, reducing toxicity, but the phrase “not a good person” is still a direct personal insult, so neutrality is only partial. CS: The core idea—that the speaker thinks negatively of the addressee—remains, but the specific notion of being stupid (idiot) is replaced by a moral judgment (not a good person), so meaning is partially but not fully preserved. FS: The sentence is understandable but contains punctuation/capitalization issues (capital ‘But’ after a conjunction, missing comma), so fluency is mediocre."
"Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be an arse hole","Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be an unpleasant person",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The insult ""arse hole"" has been replaced with the neutral phrase ""unpleasant person,"" fully removing the toxic wording (STA=1). The overall message—addressing Greenman and saying he has again shown himself to be disagreeable—remains intact, so the core meaning is preserved (CS=1). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and easy to read (FS=1)."
"You're not an admin, so shut the fuck up faggot.","You're not an admin, so stop talking.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All toxic elements (obscenity 'fuck', slur 'faggot', and the harsh phrase 'shut ... up') have been removed or softened to a neutral command, so toxicity is fully eliminated. 
CS: The core meaning—informing the person they are not an admin and therefore should be quiet—is completely preserved with no factual or intent loss. 
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and natural-sounding: ""You're not an admin, so stop talking."" Hence it is fully fluent."
"Yes, the wikipedia page, like I just mentioned, dumbass.","Yes, the wikipedia page, like I just mentioned, is not good.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The explicit insult ""dumbass"" has been completely removed and no other toxic wording remains, so the sentence is fully neutral (score 1). CS: The original utterance simply confirms that the speaker has already mentioned the Wikipedia page while insulting the interlocutor. The neutral version adds new information (""is not good""), introducing an evaluation of the page that was not present in the source. Therefore some meaning is altered (score 0.5). FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical and easy to read; the only very minor issue is the lowercase 'w' in 'wikipedia', which does not impede fluency (score 1)."
"oh shit, nooooo, is someone going to spank me now?","Oh nooooo, is someone going to me now?",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"STA: The toxic word “shit” and the potentially offensive phrase “spank me” have been removed, leaving no toxic or aggressive language, so STA = 1.0.
CS: The key action word “spank” is completely omitted, so the question loses its central meaning (whether someone will spank the speaker). The remaining sentence no longer conveys the same idea, so CS = 0.0.
FS: The resulting sentence is ungrammatical: “is someone going to me now?” is incomplete and confusing, making it difficult to understand. Therefore, fluency is very poor, FS = 0.0."
steak Diane Please stop fucking up my edits on steak diane. Thank you.,Diane Please stop up my edits on Diane. Thank you.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The obscene phrase “fucking up” has been completely removed, and no other toxic language is present, so the style is neutral (1.0). CS: The main request—asking someone to stop altering the speaker’s edits—is retained, but important details are lost or distorted: “steak Diane” becomes just “Diane,” and the verb phrase “fucking up my edits” (i.e., ruining them) is reduced to the odd expression “stop up my edits,” which only partially conveys the original meaning. Therefore partial preservation (0.5). FS: The sentence is understandable but awkward: repetition of “Diane,” the construction “stop up my edits,” and missing punctuation after the first word make it less fluent, though still readable, so 0.5."
You amins are such bastards.,You are such people.,1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The insulting word ""bastards"" is completely removed and the sentence contains no toxic or aggressive language, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0.
CS: The original sentence conveys a negative judgment toward ""amins/admins""; the neutral version not only drops the negative judgment but also removes the specific target (""amins""), replacing it with the vague word ""people."" Thus the core meaning (addressing admins and expressing disapproval) is lost, giving Content Similarity 0.0.
FS: ""You are such people"" is grammatically acceptable but sounds awkward and unidiomatic in English, reducing readability. Therefore Fluency is 0.5."
"Quit Defacing my user page, you ugly cunt.-",Quit Defacing my user page.-,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive phrase ""you ugly cunt"" has been completely removed, leaving a neutral request; no toxic language remains. CS: The main message—asking someone to stop defacing the user page—is fully retained, and the removed part was purely abusive, so the core meaning is preserved. FS: The sentence is understandable but has minor fluency issues: the capitalized ""Defacing"" mid-sentence and the unusual trailing ""-."" punctuation make it slightly awkward. Hence fluency is scored 0.5."
I forgot to mention the even sadder cunt that is,I forgot to mention the even worse thing that is,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The slur ""cunt"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""thing"" and no other toxic wording remains, so toxic content is fully removed (1.0). CS: The sentence still conveys that the speaker forgot to mention something/someone they judge negatively (""even sadder"" -> ""even worse""), keeping the core meaning intact (1.0). FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but remains fragmentary and awkward (""that is"" without completing clause), so it is only partially fluent (0.5)."
Randi was born a DICK.,Randi was born a bad person.,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The vulgar insult ""DICK"" has been replaced, so the explicit toxicity is removed, but the sentence still passes a negative moral judgment (""bad person""), which keeps some insulting tone; therefore only partial detoxification (0.5). CS: Calling someone a ""dick"" conveys that the speaker thinks the person is unpleasant or immoral; describing them as a ""bad person"" preserves that core meaning, so content is fully kept (1.0). FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and easy to read with no errors (1.0). Joint score is the average of the three dimensions."
This is your last warning; stop being an asshole.,This is your last warning; stop being rude.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The vulgar insult ""asshole"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""rude,"" eliminating toxic language entirely.
CS: The neutral sentence retains all core information: it is still a final warning instructing the addressee to change their behavior. The slight softening of tone does not alter the factual meaning, so preservation is complete.
FS: The sentence is grammatically correct and easily readable with no awkward phrasing.
Therefore, all three dimensions receive full marks."
I am Nancy and I like to fuck up people's fun.,I am Nancy and I like to interrupt people's fun.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The vulgar phrase “fuck up” has been replaced with the neutral verb “interrupt,” fully eliminating toxic language. CS: The new sentence still conveys that Nancy enjoys disrupting other people's fun; the core idea of intentionally spoiling enjoyment is maintained, so the meaning is preserved. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical and reads naturally with no awkward phrasing. Hence full scores in all dimensions."
"Heh, look, not EVERYTHING is on google. you are a dumbass.","Heh, look, not EVERYTHING is on google. you are not a good person.",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The insult ""dumbass"" has been replaced by the neutral phrase ""not a good person"", removing explicit profanity and toxic language, so toxic content is fully neutralised (1.0). CS: The original sentence calls the addressee stupid, while the rewritten sentence criticises the addressee’s character ('not a good person'). The negative stance is kept, but the specific meaning (lack of intelligence vs moral judgement) changes, so only partial preservation (0.5). FS: The sentence is understandable and grammatically sound overall, but there are minor issues (lower-case ""you"" at sentence start, lowercase ""google""), so fluency is adequate but not perfect (0.5)."
Thanks for being an ass when I tried to help.,Thanks for being rude when I tried to help.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The insulting term ""ass"" is replaced by the neutral word ""rude,"" fully removing toxic language. CS: The substitution keeps the original meaning—expressing gratitude sarcastically while noting the person's impolite behavior—so no core information is lost. FS: The neutral sentence is concise, grammatically correct, and easy to read, showing full fluency."
"You're a fucking moron, go read the notability guidelines.","You're not a good person, go read the notability guidelines.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.25,"STA: The explicit profanity ('fucking moron') was removed, but the sentence still contains a direct personal insult ('not a good person'), so toxicity is only partially reduced. CS: The directive to read the notability guidelines is preserved, but the nature of the insult changes from calling the person stupid to calling them morally bad; thus the core meaning is only partly maintained. FS: The sentence is grammatically correct and easy to read, so fluency is high."
Some bubble tea for you! thanks ass hole,Some bubble tea for you!,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic insult ""ass hole"" has been fully removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so score is 1.0. CS: The original conveyed both the gesture (offering bubble tea) and a phrase of thanks (combined with the insult). The neutral text preserves the gesture but omits the word ""thanks,"" losing part of the non-toxic information; therefore only partial meaning is retained, giving 0.5. FS: The resulting sentence is short, grammatical, and completely fluent, so 1.0."
And your dumb people fell for his shenanigans.,And your people fell for his shenanigans.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive adjective ""dumb"" has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence. CS: Aside from dropping the insult, the sentence still conveys that the addressee’s people were deceived by someone’s shenanigans, so the core meaning is fully preserved. FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and perfectly fluent."
These people are INSANE.,These people are not good.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The insulting word ""INSANE"" has been replaced with the neutral phrase ""not good,"" fully removing the ableist/toxic content, so STA = 1.
CS: The original conveys a strong negative judgment (“insane” ≈ crazy). The neutral text still expresses a negative judgment but in a much vaguer way (“not good”), losing the specific meaning/intensity. Core sentiment is retained but partially diluted, so CS = 0.5.
FS: ""These people are not good."" is short, grammatical, and easy to understand. No fluency issues, so FS = 1."
Did you know that you are an ugly piece of shit?,Did you know that you are not good?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The offensive words ""ugly"" and ""piece of shit"" have been removed and replaced with the neutral phrase ""not good,"" so the output is free of toxic language (score 1). CS: The original sentence conveys a strong negative judgment about the addressee's appearance and worth; the neutral version still expresses a negative judgment but loses the specific notions of ugliness and worthlessness, so only part of the meaning is preserved (score 0.5). FS: The sentence is grammatically correct and easy to read, albeit slightly awkward, thus considered fluent (score 1)."
Be careful who you call a moron.,Be careful who you call a person.,1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The toxic word ""moron"" has been completely removed and no new offensive language is introduced, so the sentence is neutral (score 1).
CS: The original warning concerned calling someone a moron (i.e., insulting them). The rewritten sentence warns about calling someone ""a person,"" which changes the intent and loses the core meaning (score 0).
FS: The sentence is grammatically correct, but the phrasing ""call a person"" sounds odd and slightly confusing; readability is somewhat affected (score 0.5)."
"Yeah, you can fuck off incel.","Yeah, you can leave incel.",0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA: The phrase “fuck off” was replaced with the neutral verb “leave,” removing the explicit profanity. However, the pejorative term “incel” is still present, so the toxic tone is only partially mitigated.  CS: The core message—telling the addressee to go away—remains intact, so the original meaning is fully preserved.  FS: The sentence is understandable but slightly awkward; without a comma it reads as if someone should 'leave incel' (a noun) rather than addressing the person ('leave, incel'). This minor punctuation/clarity issue lowers fluency to 0.5."
"Stop defending pedophiles, faggot.",Stop defending people.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The slur ""faggot""—the only explicitly toxic element—has been completely removed, and the resulting sentence is fully neutral, so STA = 1. CS: The main directive 'Stop defending ___' is retained, but the specific object has shifted from 'pedophiles' to the generic 'people,' which drops an essential piece of information from the original meaning. Thus only partial preservation, CS = 0.5. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, concise, and easy to read, so FS = 1."
"No one is vandalizing assholes, so get it straight!!!","No one is vandalizing, so get it straight!!!",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral version removes the explicit insult ""assholes,"" leaving a fully neutral sentence, so toxic content is completely eliminated. CS: The original claim—'No one is vandalizing, so get it straight'—is fully preserved; dropping the slur does not change the factual statement or the imperative, therefore the core meaning is intact. FS: The resulting sentence is grammatically correct and easy to read; punctuation and wording are fluent."
"DUDE CALM THE FUCK DOWN!!!
",CALM DOWN!!!,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity ""FUCK"" has been removed and no other toxic language remains, resulting in a fully neutral sentence.
CS: The core meaning—an imperative telling someone to calm down—is completely preserved; dropping the informal address ""DUDE"" does not change the essential intent.
FS: The sentence is short, grammatical, and fully understandable (all-caps and exclamation marks mirror the original emphatic tone), so fluency is intact."
"Some jackass vandalized the article again, can someone fix it?","Some vandalized the article again, can someone fix it?",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The insulting term ""jackass"" has been removed, leaving no toxic or offensive language, so style transfer is successful.
CS: The core idea (an unidentified person vandalized the article and help is requested) is mostly preserved, but the sentence loses the explicit subject noun; ""Some"" without a following noun is vague and slightly obscures who performed the action. Therefore, only partial semantic preservation is credited.
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but not fully grammatical—""Some vandalized the article"" is awkward; it should read ""Someone vandalized"" or similar. This grammatical flaw lowers overall fluency."
I'm afraid I can't verify it as his myspace account has been deleted I fucking hate you.,I'm afraid I can't verify it as his myspace account has been deleted I hate you.,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicit profanity ('fucking') is removed, so the text is less aggressive, but the phrase 'I hate you' is still directly hostile. Toxicity is only partially mitigated, so 0.5.
CS: Apart from removing the swear word, all semantic information— inability to verify due to deleted Myspace account and the speaker’s hatred— is preserved. No real meaning loss, so 1.0.
FS: The sentence remains a run-on with no punctuation separating the two clauses, creating a grammatical flaw though still understandable. Therefore 0.5."
He deserves every beating and rape he will be subjected to.,He deserves every beating and he will be subjected to.,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"STA: The word ""rape""—a highly toxic element—was removed, but the sentence still states that he ""deserves every beating,"" which continues to advocate violence. Therefore toxicity is only partially reduced, warranting 0.5.
CS: The new sentence keeps the idea that he deserves violent harm, but omits the rape component and leaves an incomplete clause, so only part of the original meaning is preserved → 0.5.
FS: The neutral text is understandable but ungrammatical: ""he will be subjected to"" lacks an object, making the sentence sound truncated. This yields moderate fluency → 0.5."
"MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize, so fuck you.","MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize, so sorry.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the vulgar expression 'fuck you' and replaces it with a more neutral phrase 'sorry.' The core meaning of the original text is fully preserved, and the language is fluent with no grammatical errors."
