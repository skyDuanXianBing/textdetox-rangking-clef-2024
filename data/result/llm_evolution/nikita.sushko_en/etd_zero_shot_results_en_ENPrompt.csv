any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,Any of us who did half this would be locked up already .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: All profane words ('shit', 'the fuck') are removed, and no new toxic language is introduced, so toxic content is fully neutralised → 1.
CS: Aside from eliminating profanities, every informational element (""any of us"", ""did half"", ""would be locked up already"") is preserved, so the core meaning is completely retained → 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is easily understandable, but the phrasing ""did half this"" is slightly ungrammatical; a fluent version would be ""did half of this."" Because of this minor grammatical roughness, fluency is not perfect → 0.5."
are they liars or just clueless ?,Are they lies or just clueless?,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"STA: The original toxicity comes mainly from the direct insult ""liars"" (and, to a lesser extent, ""clueless""). The system changed ""liars"" to ""lies,"" softening that insult, but it kept ""clueless,"" which is still a negative label. Therefore toxic content is only partially removed → 0.5.

CS: The core idea is a question contrasting two possible characterisations: liars vs. clueless. Replacing ""liars"" with the noun ""lies"" breaks that contrast and makes the sentence semantically odd (people cannot literally be ""lies""). Some meaning is therefore lost, though part of the structure (""or just clueless"") remains → 0.5.

FS: ""Are they lies or just clueless?"" is understandable, but ungrammatical/unnatural (people aren’t ""lies""). This awkwardness reduces fluency, though it is still readable → 0.5."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .","As someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is not good.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive phrase “piece of shit” has been replaced by the neutral expression “not good,” so all explicit toxicity is removed (score 1).
CS: The speaker’s viewpoint (someone from LA and an oil-field worker stating a negative opinion about ‘this guy’) is fully preserved; only the intensity of the insult is softened, but the core meaning—that the speaker thinks poorly of the person—remains (score 1).
FS: The sentence is understandable and syntactically correct, but it keeps the original lowercase ‘la’ and ‘i’, which are minor grammatical errors. These issues reduce polish yet do not impede comprehension, so fluency is partial (score 0.5)."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","calm down , cnn .",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive word ""fuck"" has been removed, leaving a neutral imperative, so toxic content is fully eliminated (score 1).
CS: Aside from deleting the swear word, the sentence still tells CNN to calm down; no meaningful information is lost (score 1).
FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable, but it has minor punctuation and capitalization issues (extra spaces before punctuation, all-lowercase). These issues do not impede comprehension but prevent it from being perfectly fluent (score 0.5)."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,china and russia will use a big stick to trump around if those ships do anything,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"Style Transfer Accuracy (0.5): The most explicitly aggressive phrase ""smack trump around"" was removed, and the adjective ""foolish"" was dropped, reducing direct harassment. However, the violent image ""use a big stick"" is still present and the sentence still conveys a threat, so the text is only partially detoxified.
Content Similarity (0.5): The main idea—China and Russia threatening action if the ships act—is still discernible, but the substitution ""to trump around"" distorts the meaning and removes the specific target (Trump). The modifier ""foolish"" is lost as well. Thus, only partial preservation of meaning.
Fluency (0.5): The sentence is understandable but ungrammatical: ""to trump around"" is nonsensical, a final period is missing, and the sentence feels incomplete after ""anything."" These issues lower readability, though it is not completely unintelligible.
Joint score is the average of the three sub-scores."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,These people rarely care about facts.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic insult ""cretins"" has been replaced with the neutral phrase ""These people,"" fully removing the offensive language, so STA = 1.
CS: The sentence still conveys that the referenced individuals rarely care about facts; only the toxic tone is removed, so the core meaning is fully preserved, giving CS = 1.
FS: ""These people rarely care about facts."" is a clear, grammatical, and fluent sentence with no errors, so FS = 1."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,Do people actually believe this?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""shit"" has been completely removed, and no other offensive language remains, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: The question ""Do people actually believe this?"" conveys the same core idea—expressing doubt that others believe something—as the original. The loss of the insulting word does not alter the factual content of the utterance, so Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and fully fluent, so Fluency is 1."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .",0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The neutral text repeats the exact same threatening sentence, retaining the explicit violent threat (“i will cut you”). No toxic language was removed, so the score is 0.
CS: Because the two sentences are identical, every piece of meaning is preserved, so content similarity is perfect (1).
FS: The sentence is understandable but contains several fluency issues: lack of capitalization, missing apostrophes for contractions (""don't"", ""I'll""), extra spaces before commas, and an overall informal structure. These errors impair correctness but not comprehension, so it merits 0.5.
Joint score: (0 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.5."
even bush knows he fucked up .,Even Bush knows he was wrong.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity 'fucked up' is replaced with the neutral phrase 'was wrong,' eliminating toxic language entirely, so STA = 1. CS: Both sentences express that even Bush realizes he made a mistake; the core proposition is fully retained, so CS = 1. FS: 'Even Bush knows he was wrong.' is a well-formed, grammatical English sentence with correct capitalization and punctuation; therefore FS = 1."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,Popeyes for doing this in the first place.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicit toxic word ""fuck"" is entirely removed, and no other slur or profanity remains, so the sentence is fully neutral (score 1). CS: The core topic (Popeyes doing something ""in the first place"") is retained, but the speaker’s negative judgement is largely lost and the sentence becomes a fragment, so only partial meaning is preserved (score 0.5). FS: The output is understandable but it is a sentence fragment lacking a main verb, making it mildly ungrammatical and less natural; hence it is partially fluent (score 0.5)."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,Getting my kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only potentially toxic element is the profanity ""ass"". It has been completely removed, leaving no other insulting or toxic language, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from the removed profanity, all other words remain. However, deleting ""ass"" breaks the idiom ""getting my ass kicked,"" turning it into ""Getting my kicked,"" which no longer clearly conveys that the speaker was badly beaten by the GRE practice tests. Because the core meaning can still be inferred but is degraded, CS = 0.5.
FS: The resulting sentence is grammatical problematic: ""Getting my kicked"" is ungrammatical and awkward, though the rest of the sentence is intact and readers can still understand the intent. Hence it is partially fluent but not fully, so FS = 0.5.
Joint score: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.67."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,getting stronger every month yeah i wish .,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element was the expletive ""fucking"". It has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so the style transfer accuracy is perfect.
CS: Aside from deleting the expletive, no information or meaning has been lost. The statement still expresses a wish to be getting stronger every month, so content similarity is fully preserved.
FS: The sentence is short, grammatical, and fully understandable. Although it lacks capitalization and has an extra space before the period, these minor quirks do not impede readability, so fluency is considered perfect."
have you ever been to r trees and seen all the shit people say weed can do ? .,Have you ever been to r trees and seen all the things people say weed can do ? .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the profanity ""shit."" In the neutral sentence it is replaced with the neutral word ""things,"" so all toxic language is removed – score 1.
CS: Aside from the substitution of the profane word, all lexical items and structure remain the same. The question still asks whether the speaker has visited r/trees and seen the various claims about weed. Core meaning is fully retained – score 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable and grammatically fine in terms of word order, but it contains awkward punctuation: an unnecessary space before the question mark and an extra period after it (""? .""). These minor errors hurt fluency but do not seriously impede comprehension, warranting a 0.5 rather than 1.0."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .",Why a cop got fired?,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The profanity “holy shit” has been removed and no new toxic language is introduced, so toxic content is fully neutralised (score 1).
CS: Both sentences still revolve around the fact that a police officer was fired, but the neutral version changes the intent from an exclamatory/astonished question (""A cop got fired?"") to asking for the reason (""Why a cop got fired?""). Core topic retained, nuance altered, so partial preservation (score 0.5).
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but ungrammatical; standard English would be ""Why was a cop fired?"" or ""Why did a cop get fired?"" Hence some fluency issues yet still readable (score 0.5)."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,How do you manage that?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity 'fuck' has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so the toxic content is fully eliminated.
CS: Aside from removing the expletive, the question’s meaning (‘How do you manage that?’) is fully retained without any information loss.
FS: The neutral text is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and ends with a single question mark, making it fully fluent."
how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,How do you think people afford houses and cars?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the single toxic word ""fuck,"" leaving a fully polite construction; therefore, toxic content is completely eliminated (score 1). CS: Apart from deleting the profanity, every word and the interrogative intent are retained, so the core meaning is fully preserved (score 1). FS: The neutral version is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and reads smoothly; no fluency issues are present (score 1). The average of the three dimensions is 1.0."
i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,I accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost annoyed.,1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the profane phrase ""shit my pants"" and contains no other toxic or offensive wording, so toxic content is fully eliminated (score 1).
CS: While the event (mis-reading the title) is retained, the emotional reaction changes from strong fear/surprise (""shit my pants"") to mild irritation (""almost annoyed""). This alters the core meaning of the sentence, so preservation of content is insufficient (score 0).
FS: The sentence is understandable, but the phrase ""and almost annoyed"" is grammatically incomplete (it should be ""and was almost annoyed"" or similar). This makes the sentence somewhat awkward though still comprehensible (score 0.5)."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,I did not vandalize anything.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic slur ""dick"" has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so style transfer accuracy is 1.
CS: The statement still conveys exactly the same factual content (the speaker denies vandalizing anything). The only removed part is the insult, which is not core to the meaning, so content similarity is 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is fully grammatical, correctly capitalized, and reads naturally, so fluency is 1."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,I dont care about sides !,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The profanity phrase “flying fuck” has been entirely removed and replaced with neutral wording, so the detoxification is complete → 1.
CS: The original sentence expresses indifference toward “sides.” The neutral version still conveys not caring about sides, with no loss of core meaning → 1.
FS: The sentence is readable, but it lacks the apostrophe in “don’t” and has an unnecessary space before the exclamation mark. These minor grammatical issues reduce fluency, so → 0.5."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,I have toilet paper to wipe my and no shortage of food.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the vulgar word ""ass"". The neutral sentence removes this word and contains no other offensive language, so style transfer is fully successful (1).
CS: Most of the original information is preserved: the speaker still says they have toilet paper and no shortage of food. However, the object of the verb ""wipe"" has been deleted, leaving an incomplete phrase (""wipe my""). This erases a small but explicit part of the meaning, so only partial preservation is credited (0.5).
FS: The sentence is understandable, but the fragment ""to wipe my"" is grammatically incomplete, causing noticeable disfluency. Because the error does not make the sentence impossible to comprehend, it earns a middle score (0.5)."
i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but fucking seriously .,I mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but seriously.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the expletive ""fucking"". It has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence; therefore STA = 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the offensive word, every other word and the overall meaning (that the speaker thinks it is awesome that the pope is cool, but is still somewhat incredulous) remains intact. No information loss, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, fully understandable, and flows naturally. Capitalization is consistent and no errors are present, so FS = 1."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","I sell quite a bit of stuff on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element was the profanity ""shit""; it has been fully replaced by the neutral word ""stuff,"" so all toxicity is removed (score 1).
CS: Apart from the substitution of the profanity with a semantically close word, the sentence keeps exactly the same propositions (selling a lot on a site and PayPal helping pay bills). No information is lost (score 1).
FS: The sentence is understandable and largely correct, but there are minor fluency issues: (1) an unnecessary space before the comma in ""there ,"" and (2) ""paypal"" should be capitalized as ""PayPal."" These small errors detract from perfect fluency, so the score is 0.5."
"if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the shit out of him .","If hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute him.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the phrase ""the shit out of"". It is completely removed in the neutral version, leaving no offensive language. Hence STA = 1.
CS: The neutral sentence retains the conditional situation (""If he's found to have acted in cold blood"") and the consequence (""the feds are going to persecute him""). Although the original intensifier is dropped, the core meaning—that the feds will persecute him if he acted in cold blood—remains intact. Therefore CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it contains minor grammatical/orthographic issues: ""hes"" should be ""he's,"" and there are unnecessary spaces before commas. These small errors reduce fluency, so FS = 0.5.
The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
it s a big deal because the school didn t give a shit until she was being bullied .,it s a big deal because the school didn't care until she was bullied.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The profanity ""give a shit"" has been replaced with the neutral verb ""care,"" eliminating the toxic expression entirely, so the style transfer is fully successful.
CS: All essential information (that the issue is significant because the school only reacted after she was bullied) is preserved; the slight change from ""was being bullied"" to ""was bullied"" does not alter the meaning. Hence full content preservation.
FS: The sentence reads smoothly overall, but the contraction is incorrectly written as ""it s"" instead of ""it's,"" constituting a minor grammatical error. Because the rubric requires absolutely no grammatical errors for a 1.0, fluency is rated 0.5.
The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
"judging by the shit i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .","judging by the things i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the profanity ""shit"". It has been fully replaced with the neutral term ""things"", so all toxicity is removed and the sentence is neutral → 1.
CS: Aside from the profanity-to-neutral substitution, every other element (""judging by"", ""i ve seen"", ""in my number years"", ""number of those spent with george w."") is preserved, so the core meaning remains intact → 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable, but still contains issues such as the lowercase ""i"", the awkward phrase ""my number years"", lack of contractions/apostrophes, and comma placement. These make it less than fully fluent, though not incomprehensible → 0.5."
"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up","Last warning, it takes meminutes to resolve a page so you can wikipedia up",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA – All explicit toxic elements ('fucking', 'tosser', 'cunts', the expletive verb phrase 'fuck … up') have been removed, leaving a neutral tone, so the detoxification goal is fully met (score 1). CS – The main idea of a final warning and the claim that the speaker can fix a page quickly is still present, but the phrase 'so you can Wikipedia up' no longer clearly conveys the original sense of 'so people like you can mess Wikipedia up'. Consequently part of the meaning is lost (score 0.5). FS – The sentence is understandable but not fully fluent: it keeps the typo 'meminutes' and the construction 'wikipedia up' is ungrammatical. These issues hinder natural reading though the message can still be grasped (score 0.5)."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .","Liar, liar on fire justin.",0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The neutral sentence still calls Justin a ""liar,"" which is the core toxic element of the source. Removing the word ""pants"" does not eliminate the insult, so almost no detoxification has occurred (score 0). CS: The neutral sentence still conveys that Justin is being called a liar, preserving the original message completely (score 1). FS: The sentence is understandable, but it is oddly phrased and missing punctuation (e.g., should be ""Liar, liar, on fire, Justin""). These minor grammatical issues lower fluency to 0.5."
my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,My thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger person.,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The insulting phrase ""dirt bag"" has been fully removed and replaced with the neutral word ""person."" No other toxic or insulting language remains, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: The original sentence asserts that the new person is potentially ""an even bigger dirt bag,"" conveying a strong negative judgment. The rewritten sentence merely says the new person might be ""an even bigger person,"" which drops the negative connotation entirely. Because this changes the core meaning from a harsh criticism to a neutral (or ambiguous) statement, the key semantic content is lost. Therefore Content Similarity is 0.
FS: The neutral sentence is well-formed, grammatical, and easily understandable: ""My thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger person."" No noticeable errors, so Fluency is 1.
Joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (1 + 0 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","No way number bricks fits in a car, this is bs.",0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicit profanity ""fucking"" has been removed, but the sentence still contains the slang abbreviation ""bs"" (standing for “bullshit”), which is profane. Therefore, toxic content is only partially removed → 0.5.
CS: Apart from deleting the word ""fucking,"" the neutral sentence keeps all the original information: disbelief that a certain number of bricks can fit in a car and the dismissal as ‘bs.’ Core meaning wholly preserved → 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it is not fully grammatical: ""number bricks fits"" is awkward/missing an article (e.g., ""that number of bricks"") and the comma splice makes it slightly clumsy. Hence, it is somewhat fluent but not perfect → 0.5."
noones asking you to invade shit .,No one asks you to invade.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""shit"" has been fully removed and no new toxic words were introduced, so the rewritten sentence is completely neutral.
CS: The core meaning – that nobody is asking the addressee to invade – is entirely preserved. Dropping the filler word ""shit"" does not alter the proposition, so content retention is complete.
FS: The sentence ""No one asks you to invade."" is grammatical, clear, and easily understandable. Although some might prefer the progressive form ""is asking,"" the simple present is acceptable English and does not harm readability. Therefore it is fully fluent."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,not around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the expletive “fucking.” It has been entirely removed, leaving no other offensive content, so the style transfer accuracy is 1.
CS: The source sentence means ‘not (fucking) around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about.’ In the neutral version the intensifier is gone, but the phrase now reads ‘not around in foreign matters…,’ which drops the verb ‘around’ was attached to (‘fucking around’). The core idea (avoid involvement in foreign matters we can’t influence) is partially inferable but the grammatical mismatch blurs the action, resulting in partial meaning loss → 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable, yet syntactically awkward: ‘not around in foreign matters…’ lacks a main verb and feels incomplete. This lowers fluency but it is still decipherable → 0.5."
nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady as fuck .,nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only overtly toxic element in the source is the profanity phrase “as fuck.” The neutral version deletes this phrase entirely, leaving no offensive or abusive language. Hence STA = 1.
CS: All informational content (missing footage, unaccounted-for time, appearance of shadiness) is preserved; only an intensifier was removed. The core meaning— that the absence of footage makes the situation look shady—remains intact. Therefore CS = 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, coherent, and fully understandable. It reads naturally even without the profanity, with no errors that hamper comprehension. Thus FS = 1."
number will solve alot of fucking problems if it comes down to it .,number will solve alot of problems if it comes down to it.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element was the expletive ""fucking,"" which has been removed; the resulting sentence is neutral, so STA = 1.
CS: Except for the removed profanity, every lexical item and the causal meaning (a certain number will solve many problems if needed) is retained, so the core meaning is fully preserved → CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but contains a spelling error (""alot"" instead of ""a lot"") and remains somewhat awkward stylistically. These minor issues lower fluency to 0.5 rather than 1.0.
Joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random shit like this .,org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of things like this .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic word ""shit"" has been completely removed and replaced with the neutral term ""things,"" so the sentence no longer contains any offensive language (score 1).
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the core proposition—there are Wikipedia articles for many items of this kind. Although the adjective ""random"" is omitted, the phrase ""all sorts of"" still conveys the same notion of variety; no essential information is lost (score 1).
FS: The sentence is understandable but has minor fluency issues: it lacks capitalization, the contraction ""there's"" is written as ""there s,"" and there is an unnecessary space before the period. These minor errors lower readability slightly but do not make the sentence hard to understand (score 0.5)."
"ouch man , them swedes were dicks to norway =\",They were not good to Norway =\,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The toxic insult ""dicks"" is removed and replaced with neutral wording, so the sentence is fully detoxified (score 1).
CS: The original states that ""them Swedes were dicks to Norway,"" explicitly identifying Swedes as the agents. The neutral sentence says only ""They were not good to Norway,"" omitting that it was the Swedes. Thus the core idea (someone treated Norway badly) is kept, but a key piece of information (who) is lost (score 0.5).
FS: The sentence is understandable and grammatically simple, but the phrasing ""not good to Norway"" is slightly awkward and the emoticon ""=\"" detracts from formal fluency. Minor issues warrant a partial deduction (score 0.5)."
people are idiots for wasting emergency call time on crap like this .,people are rude for wasting emergency call time on things like this.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit insult ""idiots"" and the coarse term ""crap"" have been replaced by the neutral words ""rude"" and ""things,"" fully removing toxic language. CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys that people should not waste emergency call time and judges such behavior negatively, so the core meaning is intact. FS: The sentence is grammatical, clear, and easy to read; no errors hinder comprehension. Therefore, all three dimensions receive the top score, giving an overall joint score of 1."
"quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some idiot hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .","quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the insult 'idiot'. It has been completely removed, leaving a neutral description. Therefore, Style Transfer Accuracy = 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the abusive adjective, all informational content (saints, canonization, opposing a hierarch, even being killed, reference to ‘st.’) is preserved. Core meaning is intact, so Content Similarity = 1.
FS: The sentence is intelligible but shows several fluency problems: it begins with a lowercase letter, has unnecessary spaces before commas, and ends with an unfinished abbreviation ('st .'). These issues hinder smoothness but do not render the sentence unintelligible. Hence Fluency = 0.5.
Joint score is the average of the three subscores: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
read your own fucking link .,read your own link.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element was the swear word ""fucking"", which has been completely removed. The resulting sentence is fully neutral, so STA = 1.
CS: All informational content (the imperative to read the addressee’s own link) is preserved. No substantive meaning is lost, therefore CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is short, grammatical, and easily understood. Although it starts with a lowercase letter, this minor stylistic issue does not hinder readability. Hence FS = 1."
same crap going on in the pnw too .,same going on in the pnw too,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic element was the slang insult ""crap""; it has been removed, leaving no offensive language, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1. 
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the idea that the same situation is occurring in the PNW, but dropping the word ""crap"" removes the negative/emphatic nuance that the original conveyed, so part of the meaning is lost. Therefore Content Similarity is 0.5. 
FS: The output is understandable, but it is a fragment missing a clear subject/verb (""same going on ...""). This mirrors the original fragment but is still not fully grammatical, so Fluency is 0.5."
"shit , i d love an number pm sunset .",I d love an number pm sunset.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the expletive ""shit"". It has been completely removed, and no other offensive wording remains, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: Aside from deleting the expletive, the rest of the wording is unchanged. All original information (speaker’s wish to have a number at a certain time) is preserved, so Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but clearly ungrammatical: the contraction ""I’d"" is split as ""I d""; ""an number"" should be ""a number""; the phrase ""pm sunset"" is awkward. Because it is readable but contains several errors, Fluency is 0.5.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped in the ass .,some guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get in the wrong.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicit toxic phrase ""raped in the ass"" has been removed and replaced by the non-toxic phrase ""get in the wrong,"" so no toxic or hateful language remains (score 1). CS: The rewrite keeps the basic facts (a man robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison), but it drops the key idea that he is assaulted in prison; the new phrase is vague and does not convey the same meaning, so core information is partially lost (score 0.5). FS: The sentence is mostly grammatical, but the expression ""to get in the wrong"" is awkward, unidiomatic, and slightly confusing, which hurts readability (score 0.5)."
"someone says no , and they say fuck off we need vets only for free housing ? .","someone says no , and they say we need vets only for free housing ? .",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic expression in the source sentence is the swear phrase ""fuck off."" It has been completely removed in the neutral version, and no other offensive words remain, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the swear words, the rest of the sentence (""someone says no, and they say ... we need vets only for free housing?"") is preserved. The deletion does not alter the factual content or intent, therefore the core meaning is fully maintained, giving CS = 1.
FS: The neutral text is understandable, but the punctuation is awkward (extra spaces before commas, an unnecessary period after the question mark ""? .""). This slightly disrupts readability, though the sentence is still grammatical overall. Hence, FS = 0.5.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,Still standing up for your leader who loves himself and nobody else .,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence has removed the toxic adjectives ""lying"" and ""crazy,"" so no offensive language remains. Therefore, Style Transfer Accuracy is 1. 
CS: Although the overall message (someone continues to support a self-absorbed leader) is retained, the attributes ""lying"" and ""crazy"" also carry factual/semantic meaning that is now missing. Hence only partial preservation ⇒ 0.5. 
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and reads smoothly: ""Still standing up for your leader who loves himself and nobody else."" No errors detected, so Fluency is 1."
sucked like nothings ever sucked before .,like nothings ever before .,1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The toxic word ""sucked""—the only overtly negative element—has been completely removed, leaving no toxic or offensive language. Hence, STA = 1.
CS: The original sentence conveys that something ""sucked"" to an extreme degree. By deleting the verb ""sucked,"" the neutral text no longer states what happened; it only retains the comparative fragment ""like nothings ever before."" The core judgment (that it sucked) is lost, so the original meaning is almost entirely missing. CS = 0.
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable, but it is not fully grammatical: it starts with a lowercase word, uses the incorrect plural ""nothings"" instead of ""nothing,"" and lacks a main verb. These issues hinder fluency but do not render it incomprehensible. Therefore, FS = 0.5."
taking a stand with either party is equally retarded .,taking a stand with either party is equally unfair.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The offensive word ""retarded"" has been fully replaced with the neutral term ""unfair,"" and no other toxic language remains, so the detoxification is complete (score 1).
CS: Both sentences express a negative judgment about taking a side, but the specific nature of the judgment shifts from an assessment of intelligence/ability (""retarded"") to an assessment of justice (""unfair""). The core idea—criticizing the act of taking a stand with either party—remains, yet the nuance changes, so some meaning is lost (score 0.5).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and reads naturally: ""taking a stand with either party is equally unfair."" No fluency issues detected (score 1)."
that almost never happens excepts rarely in shit hole countries .,That almost never happens excepts rarely in countries.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The phrase “shit hole countries” was entirely removed, and the rewritten sentence no longer carries any insulting or toxic wording, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.

CS: The original statement claims the event almost never happens except (rarely) in a very specific subset of countries (""shithole countries""). The neutral version broadens this to simply ""countries,"" losing the idea that it is confined to a particular subset. The core idea (it almost never happens, except rarely somewhere) is retained, but some nuance is lost, so Content Similarity is 0.5.

FS: The sentence is understandable, but the phrase ""excepts rarely"" is grammatically incorrect (should be ""except rarely""), and the wording is a bit awkward. Hence Fluency is 0.5.

Joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.67."
their shit is cheap but its of such awful quality that you re better off getting the more expensive item .,their stuff is cheap but its of such bad quality that you re better off getting the more expensive item .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic term in the source ('shit') has been replaced with the neutral word 'stuff'. No other offensive language remains, so the toxic style is fully removed – score 1. 
CS: Apart from the substitution of a single noun ('shit' → 'stuff') and a synonym change ('awful' → 'bad'), the sentence still conveys exactly the same meaning: the item is cheap but of poor quality, and the reader is advised to buy the more expensive one – score 1. 
FS: The sentence is understandable and mostly well-formed, but it contains small grammatical issues inherited from the source: missing apostrophes in ""its"" (should be ""it's"") and ""you re"" (should be ""you're""). These minor errors lower overall fluency, so it is rated 0.5 rather than 1. 
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
they need stop tratening people like morons .,they need stop treated people like people.,1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The toxic word ""morons"" has been completely removed and no other offensive language is present, so the sentence is neutral ⇒ 1.
CS: The original message asks to stop treating people as if they are foolish (negative comparison). The rewritten sentence effectively says ""stop treating people like people,"" which reverses the intended criticism and makes little semantic sense. The key nuance—condemning belittling treatment—is lost ⇒ 0.
FS: The sentence is understandable but ungrammatical (""need stop treated"" instead of ""need to stop treating""). It reads awkwardly yet can still be parsed ⇒ 0.5."
they re both fucked up .,they re both failed.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The strong profanity ‘fucked up’ is completely removed and replaced by a neutral word (‘failed’), so no toxic language remains (score = 1).
CS: The original conveys that both subjects are in a very bad state or badly messed up. The neutral version states they ‘failed’, which keeps a negative judgement but narrows the meaning to lack of success; nuances such as being ruined or dysfunctional are lost. Hence only partial preservation (score = 0.5).
FS: The sentence is understandable but not fully grammatical: ‘they re’ lacks an apostrophe and ‘both failed’ is awkwardly phrased as ‘both failed’ without a verb (“They both failed” or “They’re both failures” would be fluent). Therefore fluency is moderate (score = 0.5)."
this guy is a total sellout with no brains for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking .,This guy is a total sellout with no brains for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking.,0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The neutral sentence retains the insults ""total sellout"", ""no brains"", and ""lacks the ability of forward thinking."" No toxic wording was removed, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 0.
CS: The neutral text is essentially identical to the toxic text (aside from initial capitalization and final punctuation). All meaning is preserved, so Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but contains awkward phrasing (e.g., ""ability of forward thinking"") and colloquial structure; therefore it is not fully polished. This fits the 0.5 category: understandable yet with minor expression issues.
Joint score: (0 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.5."
"this is a joke , are you all fucking retards ? .","this is a joke, are you all ?",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The toxic phrase ""fucking retards"" has been completely removed, and no offensive wording remains, so the style is fully neutral (score 1).
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the fragment ""this is a joke"" and still addresses the audience, but it omits the predicate that followed ""are you all"", thereby losing a significant part of the original rhetorical force (the evaluative remark about the audience). Thus the core meaning is only partially preserved (score 0.5).
FS: The sentence ""this is a joke, are you all ?"" is understandable but ungrammatical and awkward: it lacks a complement after ""are you all"" and has a stray space before the question mark. Therefore fluency is imperfect though not completely broken (score 0.5)."
this is some twilight zone shit,This is some twilight zone thing,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profane word ""shit"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""thing,"" fully removing the toxic content, so STA = 1.
CS: Aside from the profanity change, the sentence still conveys the same idea that something feels like it belongs in the Twilight Zone (i.e., strange or surreal). Core meaning is preserved, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and easy to read. No fluency issues were observed, so FS = 1."
this shit is overwhelming to think about .,This is overwhelming to think about.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""shit"" has been fully removed, resulting in a neutral sentence with no offensive language, so STA = 1.
CS: The sentence still conveys that whatever is being referred to is overwhelming to think about; no core meaning is lost (only the expletive is dropped), so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, well-capitalized, and reads smoothly, so FS = 1."
what an arse hole you are !,What a person you are!,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The insult 'arse hole' has been completely removed and replaced with neutral wording, so toxic content is fully eliminated → 1.  CS: The original sentence conveys a strong negative judgment toward the addressee. The detoxified version keeps the exclamatory structure and the idea of addressing the addressee, but it loses the hostile/negative meaning, turning it into a neutral (even mildly positive) statement. Thus, only part of the original informational intent is preserved → 0.5.  FS: 'What a person you are!' is grammatically correct, well-formed, and easy to read, with proper capitalization and punctuation → 1."
"whats the title of this report , no shit ? .",whats the title of this report?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence has removed the profane phrase ""no shit,"" so no toxic content remains (score 1). CS: The core intent—asking for the title of the report—remains unchanged; no factual information is lost (score 1). FS: The neutral sentence is understandable, but it contains a minor grammatical issue (missing apostrophe in ""what's""); therefore it is not fully error-free (score 0.5). The joint score is the average of the three subscores: (1 + 1 + 0.5)/3 = 0.83."
why the fuck does everyone hate syria so much ? .,why does everyone hate syria so much ? .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the profanity ""the fuck."" It has been completely removed, leaving a neutral formulation, so STA = 1. 
CS: Apart from deleting the profanity, every lexical item and the overall meaning (questioning why Syria is widely disliked) is fully retained, so CS = 1. 
FS: The sentence is intelligible but ends with duplicated punctuation (""? .""), which is a minor grammatical/typographical error. Because it is still easily readable but not perfectly clean, FS = 0.5. 
Joint score is the arithmetic mean of the three subscores: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
why the fuck haven 't they condemned north korea ?,Why haven't they condemned north korea?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The expletive 'fuck' has been removed, so the sentence is now fully neutral (score 1). CS: Apart from deleting the swear word, every other word and the interrogative meaning are preserved; no factual content is lost (score 1). FS: The rewritten sentence is clear and grammatical, but the proper noun 'north korea' is not capitalized, which counts as a minor writing error under the fluency criterion; hence it is rated 0.5 rather than 1. The joint score is the average: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
"yeah , comparitively fuck all because they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and smart accountants ? .","Yeah, comparitively all because they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and smart accountants ? .",1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the profanity ""fuck"" (within the expression ""fuck all""). In the rewritten sentence the profanity is completely removed, and no new toxic language is added, so STA = 1.

CS: The original phrase ""fuck all"" is an idiomatic way to say ""nothing / very little"". The neutral version keeps only the word ""all"", which flips the meaning to the opposite (suggesting everything rather than nothing). Therefore the core meaning is not preserved, yielding CS = 0.

FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable, but it still contains the misspelling ""comparitively"", awkward punctuation (""? .""), and odd word order. These issues hurt readability but do not make the sentence incomprehensible, so FS = 0.5."
yeah they don t give a fuck .,Yeah they don't care.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity ""fuck"" has been completely removed and replaced with neutral wording, so the text is fully detoxified (score 1).
CS: The original meaning—""they don't care""—is fully preserved. No information is lost or added (score 1).
FS: The sentence ""Yeah they don't care."" is grammatical, easy to read, and has no errors serious enough to impede understanding (score 1; a missing comma after ""Yeah"" is minor and does not hurt fluency).
Overall, all three dimensions receive the maximum score, yielding a joint score of 1.0."
yeh well ban me fukkers fuck you morons,yeh well ban me,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All toxic words and direct insults (“fukkers”, “fuck you”, “morons”) have been completely removed, leaving only neutral content, so Style Transfer Accuracy = 1.
CS: The core propositional meaning—speaker’s defiant invitation to be banned (“yeh well ban me”)—is fully retained. The removed portion only expressed toxicity, not new factual information, so Content Similarity = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatically acceptable, and fully intelligible. Although informal spelling (“yeh”) is used, it does not hinder comprehension, so Fluency = 1.
Overall, the average of the three scores gives a joint score of 1.0."
you have got to be insane .,You have got to be a bad person.,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.25,"STA: The toxic slur ""insane"" (mental-health-related insult) is removed, but the sentence still attacks the addressee by calling them ""a bad person."" The language is still negative and judgmental, so toxicity is only partially reduced → 0.5.
CS: The original conveys strong disapproval toward the addressee (""you must be crazy""). The neutral text also conveys disapproval but shifts the nature of the critique from mental state to moral character. Thus the overall negative stance is preserved, yet the specific meaning changes → partial preservation → 0.5.
FS: The sentence ""You have got to be a bad person."" is grammatical, clear, and natural. No fluency issues → 1.
Joint score is the average of the three individual scores: (0.5 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 ≈ 0.67."

If you want you can find sources for every thing.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The sole toxic word ""shit"" has been replaced with the neutral term ""thing""; no abusive or offensive language remains, so full credit (1).
CS: Apart from the profanity replacement, all content (‘Goths listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop’ and the possibility of finding sources) is preserved. Meaning is intact, so 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but slightly awkward: native usage would normally be “everything,” not “every thing,” and a comma after “want” would improve readability (“If you want, you can…”). These minor issues warrant a small fluency penalty, hence 0.5 instead of 1.
Overall, the joint (average) score is (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
I hate free speech it is shit.,I hate free speech it is not good.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity ""shit"" is replaced with the neutral phrase ""not good,"" removing the toxic content while keeping the sentence non-profane, so full credit (1). CS: The neutral text expresses the same strong dislike for free speech and retains the evaluation that it is bad, therefore the core meaning is fully preserved (1). FS: The sentence is short, grammatical, and immediately understandable; although a comma could improve flow, it reads fluently and has no errors that impede comprehension, so it merits full fluency (1). Joint score is the average of the three dimensions (1.0)."
"Minority Breeder Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page started for him, nice job dipshit.","Minority Breeder Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page started for him, nice job.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only explicitly toxic element in the source sentence is the insult ""dipshit."" This word has been completely removed, and the remaining text is non-toxic, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the insult, every piece of informational content (the reference to ""Minority Breeder Breeder,"" the description of him as significant, and the complaint about deleting a page) is preserved. Therefore Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable, but it contains a comma splice (""...for him, nice job"") and is somewhat awkward. These minor grammatical issues justify a Fluency score of 0.5 rather than 1.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
"This bot is seriously driving us crazy This image exists, I must kill it!","This is seriously driving us crazy This image exists, I must kill it!",0.0,0.5,0.5,0.0,"STA: The most toxic element of the source sentence is the violent threat ""I must kill it!"", which is kept unchanged in the neutral text. Therefore no real detoxification has occurred, so STA = 0.
CS: Aside from dropping the word ""bot"", the rest of the content (driving us crazy, the image exists, intention to kill it) is preserved. Because one piece of information is lost (the subject ""bot"") the preservation is only partial, hence CS = 0.5.
FS: The rewritten text is understandable, but it merges two independent clauses without proper punctuation (e.g., missing a period or conjunction after ""crazy""). This is a noticeable grammatical issue but does not render the sentence incomprehensible, so FS = 0.5.
Joint score is the arithmetic mean of the three sub-scores: (0 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.33."
Have you been fucking living under a rock?,Have you been living under a rock?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the profanity ""fucking"". The neutral sentence removes this word entirely, leaving no toxic or offensive language, so STA = 1.
CS: Aside from deleting the profanity, the sentence keeps the exact wording and rhetorical meaning (asking whether someone is unaware). No semantic content is lost, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is a perfectly grammatical, idiomatic English question with no errors, so FS = 1."
"I will do Whatever i want and it is my right, what is both of yous Problem Asshole.","I will do Whatever i want and it is my right, what is both of yous Problem.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic word in the source (“Asshole”) has been removed, and no other toxic or offensive terms remain, so toxic content is fully eliminated → 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the insult, every other word and the overall proposition (“I will do whatever I want… what is both of yours problem?”) is preserved. Removing an insult does not alter the main semantic content, so meaning is fully kept → 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it contains several grammatical and stylistic issues (improper capitalization of 'i', awkward phrase 'both of yous', missing question mark). These errors hinder smoothness but do not block comprehension → 0.5."
How the hell are you going to block me from editting?,How are you going to block me from editting?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The neutral text removes the profane phrase “the hell,” eliminating all toxic language, so it fully meets the style-transfer goal.
CS: Except for the removed profanity, every other word and the overall intent (questioning how the addressee will block the speaker from editing) remain intact. The emotional force is softened but no factual or propositional content is lost, so content is completely preserved.
FS: The sentence is clear and grammatical, but it retains the misspelling “editting” (should be ""editing""), which counts as a linguistic error. Because fluency is expected to be flawless for a score of 1, this minor error lowers the score to 0.5."
WTF How The Fuck Does This Person Merit A Page On Wikipedia.,How Does This Person Merit A Page On Wikipedia.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All toxic expressions (""WTF"", ""the fuck"") have been fully removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so score = 1. CS: Apart from deleting the expletives, the sentence still asks the same rhetorical question about whether the person deserves a Wikipedia page, so the core meaning is entirely preserved, score = 1. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical and easy to read; although every word is capitalized (a minor stylistic oddity), it causes no comprehension problems or grammatical errors, so it is treated as fully fluent, score = 1."
"I'm retired, fuckers, leave me alone.","I'm retired, leave me alone.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive word “fuckers” has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: All propositional content (speaker is retired and wants to be left alone) is preserved; only the insult was dropped, which is not core information, so Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and easily understandable (“I’m retired, leave me alone.”). No fluency issues, so Fluency is 1."
This profile has protected Bermender since day fukkin ONE.,This profile has protected Bermender since day ONE.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word “fukkin” has been completely removed and no other offensive language remains, so the style is now fully neutral (score 1). CS: Apart from deleting the profanity, every piece of information—subject, action, object, and timeframe—is identical; therefore the core meaning is entirely preserved (score 1). FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and perfectly readable with no awkward phrasing (score 1). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1.0."
"Please carry on, so everyone can see what an ignorant arse you are.","Please carry on, so everyone can see what an uninformed person you are.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive term ""arse"" is replaced by the neutral phrase ""uninformed person,"" fully removing the toxic insult. No other derogatory language remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the original intent: encouraging the addressee to continue so observers can note their lack of knowledge. The substitution of ""ignorant"" with synonymous ""uninformed"" preserves meaning; no information is lost, thus CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and reads naturally. Minor punctuation variations do not hinder comprehension, so fluency is perfect, FS = 1."
I drive a Subaru Legacy and I'm a conservative But I still think you're an idiot.,I drive a Subaru Legacy and I'm a conservative But I still think you're not a good person.,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA: The offensive word “idiot” has been softened to “not a good person,” which is less harsh but still a direct negative judgment. Therefore, the toxic tone is only partially removed → 0.5.
CS: Every piece of factual information (driving a Subaru Legacy, being conservative, holding a negative opinion of the addressee) is retained, so the core meaning is fully preserved → 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but lacking punctuation before ""But,"" and the capitalization pattern mirrors the somewhat ungrammatical structure of the source. This yields minor fluency issues but no serious breakdown in comprehension → 0.5."
"Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be an arse hole","Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be an unpleasant person",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The insulting term “arse hole” has been fully replaced with the neutral phrase “unpleasant person,” eliminating toxic language entirely, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence retains the full semantic content: it still addresses Greenman and asserts that, as usual, he has proven to be a negative type of person. No core information is lost, so Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical and easily readable; punctuation and word choice are natural. Therefore, Fluency is 1."
"You're not an admin, so shut the fuck up faggot.","You're not an admin, so stop talking.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All toxic elements ('shut the fuck up', 'faggot') have been removed and replaced with neutral wording ('stop talking'), so the text is fully detoxified.
CS: The core message—“You’re not an admin, therefore be quiet/stop talking”—is completely retained. The removal of profanity and the slur does not alter the factual content or intent, so meaning preservation is complete.
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and easy to read with no errors. Therefore, it is fully fluent."
"Yes, the wikipedia page, like I just mentioned, dumbass.","Yes, the wikipedia page, like I just mentioned, is not good.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the toxic insult ""dumbass"" and contains no other offensive language, so toxic content is fully eliminated (score 1).
CS: The original message simply re-affirms that it is referring to the Wikipedia page and insults the interlocutor. The neutral sentence still re-affirms the reference, but it adds new information — that the page ""is not good"" — which was not present in the source. Hence some meaning is preserved (the reference) but not all, and new meaning is introduced; partial preservation warrants 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and easy to read. No noticeable fluency issues (score 1)."
"oh shit, nooooo, is someone going to spank me now?","Oh nooooo, is someone going to me now?",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only overtly toxic element in the source is the expletive ""shit."" It is fully removed in the neutral sentence and no other toxic or offensive wording remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The source asks, ""is someone going to spank me now?"" The neutral version omits the verb ""spank,"" leaving ""is someone going to me now?"" This drops the key action and thus the main meaning is only partially retained. Therefore CS = 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is mostly readable, but the phrase ""is someone going to me now?"" is grammatically incorrect (missing a verb) and sounds awkward. It is still understandable, so FS = 0.5.
Average of the three scores (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.67, reported as j_score 0.67."
steak Diane Please stop fucking up my edits on steak diane. Thank you.,Diane Please stop up my edits on Diane. Thank you.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicit profanity ""fucking"" is completely removed and no new toxic language is introduced, so the neutral text is non-toxic (score 1).
CS: The main intent—asking someone to stop harming the speaker’s edits—is still present, but important details are lost/altered: the subject ""steak Diane"" is reduced to just ""Diane,"" and the verb phrase ""stop up my edits"" no longer clearly conveys ""stop messing up my edits."" Hence partial meaning preservation (score 0.5).
FS: The sentence is understandable, but ""Diane Please stop up my edits on Diane"" is awkward, has missing punctuation after the vocative, and ""stop up my edits"" is ungrammatical. Therefore it is only moderately fluent (score 0.5)."
You amins are such bastards.,You are such people.,1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (1): The toxic term “bastards” and the insulting tone are completely removed; the sentence is fully neutral.

Content Similarity (0): The original message conveys a negative judgement about the addressees (“You … are bastards”). The detoxified version merely states “You are such people”, which does not carry any negative judgement or any other substantial information except that the addressees are people. Thus the core semantic content (the speaker’s negative evaluation) is lost.

Fluency (0.5): The sentence is grammatical and understandable, but it sounds awkward and unnatural in English (“such people” without a following clause or adjective). This mild awkwardness warrants a partial fluency score rather than a full one.

Overall, the joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 0 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.5."
"Quit Defacing my user page, you ugly cunt.-",Quit Defacing my user page.-,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic phrase ""you ugly cunt"" has been completely removed, leaving a neutral request. Therefore Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: Apart from eliminating the insult, the sentence still conveys the same core message—asking the addressee to stop defacing the user page—so Content Similarity is fully preserved. Score 1.
FS: The output is understandable but contains minor fluency issues: unnecessary capitalization of ""Defacing"" mid-sentence and the odd "".-"" punctuation at the end. These do not block comprehension but reduce grammatical correctness, so Fluency is 0.5."
I forgot to mention the even sadder cunt that is,I forgot to mention the even worse thing that is,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The strongly toxic slur ""cunt"" has been replaced by the neutral phrase ""thing"", and no new toxic language is introduced, so toxic content is fully removed → 1.
CS: The sentence still conveys that the speaker forgot to mention something/someone viewed negatively, but the specific nuance changes from ""even sadder cunt"" (a person described as sad and contemptible) to ""even worse thing"" (a vague negative object). Some semantic detail (""sadder"", the fact it is a person) is lost → 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but remains an unfinished clause ending in ""that is"", so it feels truncated/ungrammatical. No major errors besides this fragment, so partially fluent → 0.5."
Randi was born a DICK.,Randi was born a bad person.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The original toxic slur ""DICK"" is removed and replaced with the non-profane phrase ""bad person."" While it is still a negative judgment, it is not hateful or profane, so the sentence is considered neutral under the task’s definition, yielding a full score of 1. 
CS: The core meaning—that Randi is inherently an objectionable person—remains intact. No key information is lost or added, so Content Similarity is 1. 
FS: ""Randi was born a bad person."" is grammatically correct and fully understandable, with no awkward phrasing. Fluency therefore merits 1."
This is your last warning; stop being an asshole.,This is your last warning; stop being rude.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity ""asshole"" has been fully replaced with the neutral word ""rude,"" eliminating toxic language while keeping a similar admonishing tone, so the detoxification is complete (score 1). CS: The main message—issuing a final warning and asking the person to change their behavior—remains intact; only the manner of address changed from a slur to a neutral descriptor, with no loss of core information (score 1). FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, clear, and as fluent as the original, exhibiting no errors or awkward phrasing (score 1). Since all three dimensions score 1, the joint score is 1.0."
"MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize, so fuck you.","MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize, so sorry.",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The toxic phrase ""fuck you"" has been entirely removed and replaced with the neutral phrase ""sorry."" No other offensive language remains, so the detoxification is complete (score 1).
CS: The main assertions (""MY USER PAGE,"" ""I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT,"" ""I do not vandalize"") are preserved, but the ending attitude shifts from hostility to apology. This alters the speaker’s intent, so some meaning is lost/changed (score 0.5).
FS: The sentence is readable, but it retains the misspelling ""WAHT,"" uses all-caps for much of the text, and is missing punctuation that would improve clarity. These issues make it less than fully fluent though still understandable (score 0.5)."
I am Nancy and I like to fuck up people's fun.,I am Nancy and I like to interrupt people's fun.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The profane phrase ""fuck up"" has been replaced with the neutral verb ""interrupt."" No other toxic or offensive expressions remain, so toxic content is completely removed → 1.
CS: The original conveys that Nancy enjoys actively ruining other people's enjoyment. ""Interrupting"" suggests causing a temporary disruption, which is milder than ""fucking up"" (ruining/destroying). The general idea of negatively affecting others' fun is retained, but the degree of harm is softened, so part of the original nuance is lost → 0.5.
FS: ""I am Nancy and I like to interrupt people's fun."" is grammatically correct, well-formed, and easy to read → 1."
"Heh, look, not EVERYTHING is on google. you are a dumbass.","Heh, look, not EVERYTHING is on google. you are not a good person.",0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"STA: The strong profanity ""dumbass"" has been removed, which reduces toxicity, but it is replaced with the still-insulting phrase ""you are not a good person."" Because the sentence continues to attack the addressee, the text is only partially detoxified, hence 0.5.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the structure and the first clause exactly, but the nature of the insult changes from calling someone stupid to judging their moral character. This alters the core meaning of the second clause, so preservation is partial, giving 0.5.
FS: The sentence is comprehensible, but it contains minor grammatical issues (the second ""you"" should be capitalised, punctuation could be improved). This yields fluent but imperfect text, so 0.5."
Thanks for being an ass when I tried to help.,Thanks for being rude when I tried to help.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicitly insulting word ""ass"" has been substituted with the milder, non-toxic term ""rude,"" eliminating profanity while retaining the negative sentiment, so toxic language is fully removed.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps all core information—thanking someone sarcastically for their negative behavior during an attempt to help. Only the insult term is softened; no content is lost or added.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and reads naturally with no awkward phrasing or errors. Therefore, it achieves full fluency."
"You're a fucking moron, go read the notability guidelines.","You're not a good person, go read the notability guidelines.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.25,"STA: The strong profanity ('fucking moron') has been removed, but the sentence still contains an explicit negative judgement ('not a good person'), which keeps an insulting tone. Therefore, toxic content is only partially removed – score 0.5.
CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys the speaker’s negative appraisal of the addressee and the directive to read the notability guidelines. However, it changes the nature of the insult from intelligence ('moron') to moral character ('not a good person'), so part of the original semantic nuance is lost. Hence partial meaning preservation – score 0.5.
FS: The neutral text is grammatically correct and easily understandable. Although a period could replace the comma, the sentence remains fluent and natural, so full fluency – score 1.
Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (0.5 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
Some bubble tea for you! thanks ass hole,Some bubble tea for you!,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The neutral text completely removes the toxic phrase “ass hole” and contains no insulting or aggressive language, so it earns 1.0.
CS: The original sentence conveys two pieces of information: (a) offering bubble tea and (b) saying “thanks” while insulting the addressee. The neutral version keeps the offer of bubble tea but drops both the gratitude and the negative sentiment. Because part of the original (non-toxic) meaning is lost, content preservation is only partial, so 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatically correct, and perfectly readable. No errors are present, so 1.0."
And your dumb people fell for his shenanigans.,And your people fell for his shenanigans.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element ('dumb') has been removed, leaving a fully neutral sentence, so the style transfer accuracy is 1.
CS: Deleting the insult does not alter the factual proposition that 'your people fell for his shenanigans'; the core meaning is completely preserved, so content similarity is 1.
FS: The revised sentence is grammatical and fully comprehensible ('And your people fell for his shenanigans.'), therefore fluency is 1."
These people are INSANE.,These people are not good.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic adjective ""INSANE"" has been replaced with the neutral phrase ""not good,"" so all toxic or ableist language is removed – score 1.
CS: The original sentence asserted that the people were ""insane"" (i.e., crazy/irrational). The rewritten sentence merely says they are ""not good,"" keeping a negative judgment but losing the specific notion of irrationality or mental instability. Core negative sentiment is preserved, yet important nuance is lost – score 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and fully understandable. No fluency issues – score 1."
Did you know that you are an ugly piece of shit?,Did you know that you are not good?,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.25,"STA: The profanity and strong slur ('ugly piece of shit') have been removed, but the sentence still delivers a direct personal insult ('not good'), so the wording is not fully neutral. This merits a partial score of 0.5.
CS: The original intent—telling the addressee something negative about themselves—is preserved, but specifics about being 'ugly' and a 'piece of shit' are lost. Hence only partial meaning is retained, giving 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and easily understandable without awkward phrasing. No errors are present, so it receives 1.0.
Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (0.5 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 ≈ 0.67."
Be careful who you call a moron.,Be careful who you call a person.,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The toxic word ""moron"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""person,"" eliminating all offensive content, so Style Transfer Accuracy = 1.
CS: The original sentence warns against insulting someone by calling them a moron. The rewritten sentence advises caution about calling someone a person, which is a completely different and largely meaningless idea. The core meaning (warning about an insult) is lost, so Content Similarity = 0.
FS: ""Be careful who you call a person"" is grammatically correct and easy to read, even if semantically odd. No grammatical errors or awkward phrasing are present, so Fluency = 1.
Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 0 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
"Yeah, you can fuck off incel.","Yeah, you can leave incel.",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The explicit profanity 'fuck off' was replaced with the milder 'leave', but the pejorative address 'incel' (a toxic slur) is still present, so toxicity is only partially removed → 0.5.
CS: Aside from softening the verb, the sentence still conveys the same idea (telling the same person to go away); no core information is lost → 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical and clear. Although a comma before a direct form of address ('leave, incel') would improve punctuation, the sentence is easily understandable and fluent → 1."
"Stop defending pedophiles, faggot.",Stop defending people.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the homophobic slur ""faggot"" and any other hateful wording, resulting in a fully non-toxic utterance, so STA = 1.
CS: Both sentences are imperatives telling someone to stop defending a group, but the target group changes from ""pedophiles"" to the much broader ""people."" This loses the specific meaning of the original, though the general command structure is preserved. Therefore only partial preservation → CS = 0.5.
FS: ""Stop defending people."" is a short, grammatically correct, fully fluent sentence with no errors, so FS = 1."
"No one is vandalizing assholes, so get it straight!!!","No one is vandalizing, so get it straight!!!",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the insult ""assholes."" The neutral sentence deletes this word, leaving no toxic slur or abusive language. The remaining wording (""get it straight"") is firm but not hateful or profane, so the detoxification is complete → 1.
CS: Removing the insult does not alter the factual claim or imperative ('No one is vandalizing, so get it straight'). The core message—asserting that nobody is committing vandalism and urging the listener to understand—is fully preserved → 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical and clear. It retains normal punctuation (even though multiple exclamation marks are stylistic, they do not create a fluency error). No awkward phrasing or errors are present → 1."
"DUDE CALM THE FUCK DOWN!!!
",CALM DOWN!!!,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral text removes the explicit profanity ""FUCK"" and retains no other toxic or insulting language, producing a fully neutral sentence, so score = 1.
CS: The essential meaning—an imperative telling someone to calm down—is completely preserved. Dropping the vocative ""DUDE"" does not change the core intent, so score = 1.
FS: ""CALM DOWN!!!"" is a perfectly grammatical, fluent command; capitalization and exclamation marks are acceptable stylistic choices, so score = 1."
"Some jackass vandalized the article again, can someone fix it?","Some vandalized the article again, can someone fix it?",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the insult ""jackass."" This word has been completely removed and no other offensive language is present, so the rewrite is fully neutral → 1.0.
CS: Aside from dropping the insult, the sentence still conveys that an unidentified person vandalized the article again and asks for someone to fix it. The core meaning is intact → 1.0.
FS: The phrase ""Some vandalized the article again"" is imperfect English; the correct form would be ""Someone vandalized…"" or ""Somebody vandalized…"". While the sentence is understandable, this grammatical error lowers fluency → 0.5."
I'm afraid I can't verify it as his myspace account has been deleted I fucking hate you.,I'm afraid I can't verify it as his myspace account has been deleted I hate you.,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicit profanity 'fucking' has been removed, but the phrase 'I hate you' is still a direct expression of hate, which remains toxic. Therefore the toxic content is only partially removed (0.5). CS: Apart from dropping the intensifier 'fucking', the neutral text conveys exactly the same information: inability to verify due to a deleted MySpace account and the speaker's hatred. Core meaning is preserved (1). FS: The sentence is understandable, but it is a run-on lacking proper punctuation between the two independent clauses ('...deleted I hate you'). This grammatical flaw hurts fluency, though it is still readable, so a partial score is appropriate (0.5). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (0.5 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.67."
He deserves every beating and rape he will be subjected to.,He deserves every beating and he will be subjected to.,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"STA: The word ""rape""—a highly toxic element—has been removed, but the sentence still states that the person ""deserves every beating,"" which is violent and hateful. Therefore, toxic content is only partially removed, warranting a score of 0.5.

CS: The core idea that the person ""deserves every beating"" and will experience it remains, but the part about rape is missing, altering the original meaning. This represents partial preservation, so 0.5 is appropriate.

FS: The rewritten sentence is mostly understandable, but it is grammatically incomplete: ""he will be subjected to"" lacks an explicit object. This makes the sentence awkward but still comprehensible, giving it mid-level fluency (0.5)."
