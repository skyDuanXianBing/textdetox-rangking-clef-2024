Partial detoxification achieved. CS: The core meaning about China and Russia's potential response to provocative naval actions is fully preserved with identical subjects and conditional structure. FS: The phrase 'use a big stick to trump around' is grammatically awkward and unidiomatic after removing 'smack,' creating a fluency issue despite being generally understandable."

CS: 1 - The core meaning (criticism of Popeyes for a specific action) is fully preserved without any loss of information.

Thus, it only partially removes toxic content. CS: The core message about resolving pages and giving a warning is preserved, but the specific meaning about preventing people from 'fucking wikipedia up' is lost and replaced with the ambiguous 'so you can wikipedia up'.
