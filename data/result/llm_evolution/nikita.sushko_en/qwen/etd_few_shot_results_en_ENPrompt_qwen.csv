any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,Any of us who did half this would be locked up already .,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the vulgar expressions 'shit' and 'the fuck' from the original sentence, replacing them with more neutral language while maintaining the core meaning about the severity of consequences for similar actions. The rephrased version 'Any of us who did half this would be locked up already' preserves the original intent and context without any toxic language. The sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent. Therefore, all three dimensions receive full scores."
are they liars or just clueless ?,Are they lies or just clueless?,0.5,0.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text fails to preserve the original meaning: 'Are they lies or just clueless?' is nonsensical because 'lies' are not people and cannot be parallel to 'clueless' individuals, distorting the original question about people being dishonest or uninformed. Thus, content similarity is severely compromised (CS: 0.0). The toxic content in the original ('liars', 'clueless') is partially softened, but 'clueless' remains unchanged and the rephrasing does not fully achieve a neutral tone due to the incoherent substitution, resulting in only partial detoxification (STA: 0.5). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and readable, so fluency is preserved (FS: 1.0)."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .","As someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is not good.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the highly offensive phrase 'a piece of shit' and replaces it with the milder 'not good', making the language completely neutral and non-toxic, thus earning a full score for Style Transfer Accuracy. However, the replacement weakens the strength of the original sentiment — the original expression conveyed strong disapproval or contempt, which is significantly diluted in the neutral version, leading to partial loss of core meaning and a CS score of 0.5. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and readable, with no fluency issues, so Fluency receives a 1.0."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","calm down , cnn .",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'the fuck' is successfully removed and replaced with a neutral imperative 'calm down', resulting in completely neutral language. The core meaning of urging CNN to calm down is fully preserved without any significant alteration or loss of intent. The neutral text is grammatically correct, concise, and natural in expression, demonstrating high fluency. Therefore, all three dimensions receive the highest score."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,china and russia will use a big stick to trump around if those ships do anything,1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"The neutral text removes the violent metaphor 'smack trump around' and replaces it with the incomplete and vague phrase 'trump around', which eliminates the toxic tone but distorts the original meaning. The core action (punitive response by China and Russia) is not clearly preserved, leading to significant meaning loss (CS: 0.0). The sentence is partially fluent but ends abruptly and lacks grammatical completeness due to the cutoff, making it awkward and unclear (FS: 0.5). Despite the incomplete rewrite, the toxic expression is fully removed, satisfying STA."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,These people rarely care about facts.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the offensive term 'cretins' and replaces it with the neutral 'These people', making the language fully non-toxic, thus achieving full score in Style Transfer Accuracy. The core idea that individuals of a certain type do not care about facts is preserved, but the original text's emphasis on foolishness or incompetence (implied by 'cretins') is lost, leading to partial meaning preservation only. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, earning a full fluency score."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,Do people actually believe this?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the vulgar language ('shit') and uses a more neutral expression ('this'), achieving complete style transfer to a non-toxic form. However, the original text uses triple question marks for emphasis, suggesting strong disbelief or sarcasm, which is partially lost in the simplified version with a single question mark. This results in a slight loss of pragmatic meaning, though the core informational content is mostly preserved. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent. Therefore, Content Similarity is scored 0.5 due to the attenuation of expressive intensity, while Style Transfer Accuracy and Fluency both receive full marks."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text, which contains a direct threat ('i will come to your house, and i will cut you'), constituting severe toxic content. Since no detoxification has been applied, the Style Transfer Accuracy is 0.0. The original meaning is fully preserved (CS = 1.0), and the sentence is grammatically correct and fluent (FS = 1.0), but the lack of any effort to neutralize the threatening language means the detoxification has failed in its primary objective."
even bush knows he fucked up .,Even Bush knows he was wrong.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'fucked up' has been successfully replaced with the neutral and formal phrase 'was wrong', completely removing the vulgar language while maintaining a completely neutral tone. The core meaning—that Bush acknowledges a mistake—is preserved without any significant loss of information. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, with no stylistic or syntactic issues. Therefore, all three dimensions receive the highest score."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,Popeyes for doing this in the first place.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The toxic expletive 'fuck' is completely removed, resulting in a neutral expression with no offensive language, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. The core sentiment of criticism toward Popeyes is still implied, but the intensity and emotional emphasis of the original utterance are significantly reduced, leading to partial loss of meaning. The neutral text is grammatically correct and fluent, though slightly less natural due to the abrupt omission of the expletive without a clear syntactic replacement. Overall, the rewrite is fluent and neutral but with some attenuation of the original expressive intent."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,Getting my kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"The toxic phrase 'getting my ass kicked' is modified to 'getting my kicked', which removes the vulgar expression and makes the language more neutral, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the removal of 'ass' without proper substitution results in an incomplete phrase, harming grammatical integrity and slightly altering the original emphatic meaning of severe difficulty or humiliation. This leads to partial content similarity, as the core idea of learning from a harsh experience is preserved but the intensity and imagery are diminished. The fluency is impaired due to the ungrammatical construction 'getting my kicked', which is awkward and incomplete, though the rest of the sentence remains understandable. Overall, the rewrite neutralizes toxicity but at the cost of expression quality and meaning fidelity."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,getting stronger every month yeah i wish .,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'i fucking wish' is successfully replaced with the neutral 'i wish', completely removing the profanity while maintaining a natural tone.

have you ever been to r trees and seen all the shit people say weed can do ? .,Have you ever been to r trees and seen all the things people say weed can do ? .,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic term 'shit' is successfully replaced with the neutral 'things', effectively removing the vulgar language while maintaining a completely neutral tone. The core meaning of the sentence — inquiring about exposure to claims regarding weed's effects — is fully preserved. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and fluent, with no structural or stylistic issues. This represents a perfect detoxification according to the ETD framework."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .",Why a cop got fired?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the expletive 'holy shit' and transforms the expression into a more neutral and polite question, achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the original emotional surprise or shock conveyed by 'holy shit' is completely lost in the rewritten version, which only focuses on the factual inquiry about a cop being fired. Thus, while the core event (a cop getting fired) is preserved, the emotional tone and emphasis are partially lost, leading to a partial content similarity score. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with natural language flow, earning a full fluency score."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,How do you manage that?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'how the fuck' is successfully replaced with the neutral 'How', effectively removing profanity while maintaining the original meaning of the question. The core intent—expressing surprise or curiosity about someone's ability to achieve something—is fully preserved. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural in expression, demonstrating high fluency. Therefore, all dimensions receive the highest score."
how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,How do you think people afford houses and cars?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'how the fuck' is successfully replaced with the neutral 'how', completely removing profanity while maintaining a natural tone.

i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,I accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost annoyed.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the vulgar expression 'almost shit my pants' and replaces it with 'almost annoyed,' which is completely non-toxic and neutral in tone, warranting a full score for Style Transfer Accuracy. However, the replacement alters the intensity and idiomatic meaning of the original phrase—'almost shit my pants' conveys extreme surprise or fear, while 'almost annoyed' significantly underrepresents the emotional reaction, leading to partial loss of core meaning. Thus, Content Similarity is scored 0.5. The neutral text is grammatically correct and readable, with no fluency issues, so Fluency receives a full score."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,I did not vandalize anything.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the offensive term 'you dick', making the language completely neutral, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. The core assertion 'I did not vandalize anything' is preserved, but the original text includes an emphatic personal rebuttal that is partially lost in the neutral version, leading to a slight reduction in content similarity. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with no language issues."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,I dont care about sides !,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'I dont give a flying fuck' is successfully replaced with the neutral 'I dont care', which removes the profanity while maintaining the original emphasis on indifference. The core meaning regarding not caring about 'sides' is fully preserved. The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, with no structural or linguistic issues. Therefore, all dimensions receive the highest score."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,I have toilet paper to wipe my and no shortage of food.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"The original toxic text does not contain overtly toxic or offensive content—it expresses a basic statement about having toilet paper and sufficient food. Therefore, no strong detoxification was necessary, and the neutral text remains largely unchanged, successfully avoiding any toxic language (STA: 1.0). However, the neutral text contains a grammatical error: 'wipe my' is missing the word 'ass', resulting in an incomplete phrase, which affects fluency (FS: 0.5). Due to this omission, a portion of the original meaning is lost or altered, as the action is no longer clearly specified, leading to partial content preservation (CS: 0.5). Despite the minor nature of the original statement, the output's linguistic flaw reduces both fluency and content fidelity."
i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but fucking seriously .,I mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but seriously.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'fucking seriously' is appropriately replaced with the neutral 'seriously', effectively removing the profanity while maintaining the original tone of mild frustration or emphasis. The core meaning and context of the sentence are fully preserved, as the speaker still expresses admiration for the pope's coolness while questioning the sincerity or seriousness of the situation. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and fluent, with no linguistic errors. Therefore, all three dimensions receive the highest score."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","I sell quite a bit of stuff on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic term 'shit' is appropriately replaced with the neutral term 'stuff', effectively removing the vulgar language while maintaining complete neutrality. The core meaning of the sentence is fully preserved, as 'sell quite a bit of stuff' conveys the same idea as 'sell quite a bit of shit' in this context. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and fluent. Therefore, all three dimensions receive the highest score."
"if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the shit out of him .","If hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute him.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'persecute the shit out of him' has been successfully replaced with the neutral and formal 'persecute him', completely removing the vulgar language while maintaining a completely neutral tone. The core meaning regarding the severity of federal prosecution if he acted in cold blood is fully preserved. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, with no degradation in language quality. Therefore, all dimensions receive the highest score."

The core meaning of the sentence is fully preserved—highlighting the school's lack of concern until bullying occurred. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, with no degradation in language quality. Therefore, all three dimensions receive the highest score."
"judging by the shit i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .","judging by the things i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic term 'shit' has been successfully replaced with the neutral 'things', effectively removing the vulgar language while maintaining a completely neutral tone.

The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and fluent, with no issues in readability or expression. Therefore, all three dimensions receive the highest score."
"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up","Last warning, it takes meminutes to resolve a page so you can wikipedia up",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"The neutral text successfully removes highly offensive language such as 'fucking tosser' and 'cunts like you', replacing them with neutral or omitted expressions, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the phrase 'you can wikipedia up' is awkward and does not clearly convey the original intent of criticizing someone for damaging or misusing Wikipedia, leading to partial loss of meaning. Additionally, the sentence structure is somewhat broken—'meminutes' appears to be a typo or nonsensical term, and the overall phrasing lacks clarity and natural flow, resulting in minor fluency issues. Therefore, content similarity and fluency are both scored as 0.5."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .","Liar, liar on fire justin.",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text partially removes toxic content by retaining the repetitive 'liar' and the phrase 'on fire', which still carries a mocking tone derived from the childish taunt 'liar, liar, pants on fire'. While the explicit mention of 'pants' is removed, the underlying insult remains intact, so the detoxification is incomplete. However, the core meaning is preserved accurately, as the intent to accuse Justin of lying is unchanged. The output is fluent and grammatically correct, with natural phrasing. Therefore, STA is 0.5 due to incomplete neutralization of toxicity, while CS and FS score 1.0."
my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,My thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger person.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The toxic term 'dirt bag' has been successfully replaced with the neutral 'person', effectively removing the derogatory language and achieving full style transfer accuracy. The fluency of the neutral text is excellent, with no grammatical or syntactic issues. However, the content similarity is partially compromised: while the general sentiment of skepticism or negative judgment is implied, the specific intensity and qualitative criticism conveyed by 'dirt bag' is lost in the overly vague replacement 'person'. This results in a noticeable dilution of the original meaning, warranting a 0.5 for content similarity."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","No way number bricks fits in a car, this is bs.",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"The toxic expression 'fucking' is removed, but the neutral text retains the abbreviation 'bs' (bullshit), which is still a vulgar and informal expression, indicating only partial detoxification. Therefore, Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 0.5. The core meaning is fully preserved, as the sentence structure and intent remain unchanged, earning a Content Similarity score of 1.0. The neutral text is grammatically correct and readable, with only minor stylistic informality, so Fluency is 1.0."
noones asking you to invade shit .,No one asks you to invade.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the vulgar expression 'shit' and rephrases the sentence in a completely neutral tone, achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the original emphatic and informal structure 'noones asking you to invade shit' carries a dismissive or defensive attitude that is somewhat lost in the simplified version 'No one asks you to invade,' which is more literal and less contextually nuanced. Thus, while the core action (not being asked to invade) is preserved, some pragmatic and attitudinal meaning is lost, warranting a 0.5 for content similarity. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with no language errors."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,not around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The toxic expression 'fucking' is successfully removed and the resulting sentence uses neutral language, achieving full style transfer accuracy. The core idea of not being involved in foreign matters beyond one's control is partially preserved, but the emphasis or intensity conveyed by 'not fucking around'—which implies serious intent or focus—is weakened in the neutral version, leading to some loss of meaning. The neutral text is grammatically correct and readable, maintaining fluency despite the omission. Thus, content similarity is partially preserved."

The core meaning—that the missing footage makes the unaccounted time appear suspicious—is fully preserved without any loss of information. The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, with no issues in readability or expression. Therefore, all three dimensions receive the highest score."

The core meaning—that Wikipedia has articles on many varied or seemingly trivial topics—is fully preserved without any loss of information.

"ouch man , them swedes were dicks to norway =\",They were not good to Norway =\,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the offensive term 'dicks' and replaces it with the more neutral 'not good,' achieving complete de-toxification. Thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0. The fluency of the rewritten sentence is intact with no grammatical errors, so Fluency is 1.0. However, the original sentence expresses a stronger emotional judgment toward the Swedes' behavior, while 'not good' is vaguer and less specific, leading to some loss of the original nuance and intensity. Therefore, Content Similarity is scored 0.5 as the core idea is preserved but with noticeable generalization."
people are idiots for wasting emergency call time on crap like this .,people are rude for wasting emergency call time on things like this.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully replaces the derogatory term 'idiots' with the more neutral 'rude', effectively removing the toxic language and making the tone more appropriate, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the original statement criticizes people for being foolish or lacking sense ('idiots'), while 'rude' shifts the judgment from intelligence to manners, which slightly alters the intended meaning. This results in partial preservation of content, warranting a 0.5 for content similarity. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with no issues in readability or expression, so fluency is scored as 1.0."
"quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some idiot hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .","quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The toxic term 'idiot' has been completely removed and not replaced, resulting in a neutral expression. This successfully eliminates the offensive language, satisfying Style Transfer Accuracy. However, by omitting 'idiot', the specific criticism toward the hierarch's perceived foolishness is lost, leading to partial meaning loss. Thus, Content Similarity is scored 0.5. The neutral text is grammatically correct and fluent, with no structural or linguistic issues, warranting a full Fluency score."

same crap going on in the pnw too .,same going on in the pnw too,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The toxic term 'crap' has been successfully removed and replaced with a more neutral expression by omitting it, resulting in completely non-toxic language. However, the removal of 'crap' slightly alters the emphasis and tone of the original sentence, which may carry a sense of frustration or negativity that is partially lost in the neutral version, leading to a minor loss in content similarity. The neutral text is grammatically correct and readable, though slightly less natural due to the abrupt omission, but still fluent overall."
"shit , i d love an number pm sunset .",I d love an number pm sunset.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic word 'shit' is successfully removed and the resulting sentence maintains a neutral tone without any offensive language. The core meaning of the original utterance — expressing a desire for a specific time (number pm sunset) — is fully preserved. The neutral text is grammatically correct and fluent, despite the slightly awkward phrasing ('I d' instead of 'I'd'), which does not impede readability or understanding. Overall, this is a successful detoxification with no loss in meaning or fluency."
some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped in the ass .,some guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get in the wrong.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"The neutral text successfully removes the explicit and vulgar expression 'get raped in the ass' and replaces it with the vague phrase 'get in the wrong,' which avoids toxic content and achieves style transfer accuracy (STA: 1.0). However, the replacement significantly alters the original meaning — the severe consequence and violence implied in prison are lost, leading to partial meaning preservation (CS: 0.5). Additionally, the phrase 'get in the wrong' is awkward and unclear in this context, introducing a semantic ambiguity that affects readability and naturalness, resulting in minor fluency issues (FS: 0.5)."
"someone says no , and they say fuck off we need vets only for free housing ? .","someone says no , and they say we need vets only for free housing ? .",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'fuck off' has been successfully removed and replaced with a neutral continuation of the sentence, resulting in completely non-toxic language.

The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, with no syntactic or stylistic issues. Therefore, all dimensions receive the highest score."
still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,Still standing up for your leader who loves himself and nobody else .,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic descriptors 'lying' and 'crazy' and replaces them with a more neutral characterization, resulting in completely non-toxic language (STA: 1.0). However, removing these attributes alters the original speaker's strong negative judgment of the leader, which was central to the original sentiment, leading to partial loss of meaning (CS: 0.5). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent (FS: 1.0)."
sucked like nothings ever sucked before .,like nothings ever before .,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The toxic expression 'sucked like nothings ever sucked before' contains vulgar language implying extreme negativity or failure. The neutral text 'like nothings ever before' removes the offensive term and achieves a completely neutral tone, thus earning a full score for Style Transfer Accuracy. However, the core meaning related to strong negative evaluation (e.g., failure, poor performance) is significantly weakened or lost, resulting in only partial preservation of content meaning. The fluency of the neutral text is grammatically acceptable and readable, though slightly awkward due to lack of subject and verb, but still understandable in context. Hence, Fluency receives a 1.0."
taking a stand with either party is equally retarded .,taking a stand with either party is equally unfair.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The word 'retarded' is a toxic slur and has been successfully replaced with the neutral term 'unfair', effectively removing the offensive language and achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the original meaning is only partially preserved: 'retarded' was used pejoratively to imply foolishness or irrationality, while 'unfair' introduces a different conceptual dimension (moral equity) that was not the core focus of the original statement, thus leading to a moderate loss in content similarity. The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, with no language issues. Therefore, fluency is fully maintained."
that almost never happens excepts rarely in shit hole countries .,That almost never happens excepts rarely in countries.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"The neutral text successfully removes the offensive term 'shit hole' and replaces it with a more neutral expression, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the removal of 'shit hole' results in some loss of the original meaning, as the strong negative connotation about the quality of certain countries is weakened or lost, leading to a partial content similarity score. Additionally, the neutral text contains a grammatical error ('excepts rarely') which should be 'except rarely'; this affects fluency, resulting in a 0.5 fluency score despite the sentence otherwise being understandable."

they need stop tratening people like morons .,they need stop treated people like people.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"The neutral text removes the dehumanizing term 'morons' and replaces it with a more respectful expression, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the original phrase 'treating people like morons' conveys a clear implication of condescension or disrespect, which is only partially preserved in the rewritten version 'treated people like people'—this is overly vague and loses the critical nuance of the original, resulting in partial content similarity. Additionally, the neutral text contains a grammatical error ('stop treated' should be 'stop treating'), which affects fluency, though the sentence remains understandable. Hence, fluency receives a 0.5."
they re both fucked up .,they re both failed.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the vulgar expression 'fucked up' and replaces it with the more neutral term 'failed', achieving complete style transfer to a non-toxic form. However, the original phrase 'fucked up' typically conveys a sense of being emotionally or psychologically damaged, while 'failed' suggests a lack of success in a task or role, which shifts the meaning somewhat. Thus, while the general negative assessment is preserved, the specific connotation is altered, leading to partial content similarity. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with no language errors."
this guy is a total sellout with no brains for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking .,This guy is a total sellout with no brains for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text, with no modification to the offensive or derogatory language such as 'total sellout' and 'no brains for business', which are strongly negative and judgmental. Therefore, no detoxification has occurred, resulting in an STA score of 0.0. However, the original meaning is fully preserved (CS = 1.0) and the sentence is grammatically correct and fluent (FS = 1.0)."
"this is a joke , are you all fucking retards ? .","this is a joke, are you all ?",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic language by omitting the offensive term 'fucking retards', resulting in a completely neutral tone, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the removal of the phrase leads to a partial loss of the original meaning, as the rhetorical sarcasm and target of mockery are weakened or lost, resulting in a content similarity score of 0.5. The resulting sentence is grammatically correct and readable, though slightly abrupt, so fluency is maintained at a high level. The joint score is the average of the three dimensions."

However, the original emphatic criticism is significantly weakened, as 'What a person you are!' is vague and loses the specific negative connotation of the original insult, resulting in partial meaning preservation. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with no language errors. Therefore, content similarity is partially preserved due to over-neutralization leading to meaning dilution."
"whats the title of this report , no shit ? .",whats the title of this report?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'no shit?' is a sarcastic and potentially aggressive phrase that has been successfully removed, resulting in a neutral and polite question.

However, the core meaning regarding disparity due to hidden wealth and smart accountants is preserved. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, though the question mark at the end suggests uncertainty in tone. While fluency and content preservation are strong, the style transfer is only partially successful due to incomplete detoxification of the original colloquial and potentially offensive expression."

However, the core meaning is partially lost—the original expresses anger and defiance toward perceived idiots, while the detoxified version only retains the request to be banned, omitting the emotional and interpersonal elements. Despite this, the remaining content is grammatically correct and fluent, with no language errors. Thus, content similarity is reduced due to significant contextual loss, while fluency remains intact."
you have got to be insane .,You have got to be a bad person.,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'insane' and replaces it with a more neutral term 'a bad person', achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the core meaning is significantly altered: the original expresses disbelief or shock at someone's apparent irrationality, while the rewritten version makes a moral judgment about character, which is not equivalent. Thus, there is almost no preservation of the original meaning. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with no language issues."

"This bot is seriously driving us crazy This image exists, I must kill it!","This is seriously driving us crazy This image exists, I must kill it!",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text fails to remove toxic content, as the phrase 'I must kill it!' remains unchanged and retains violent intent, resulting in a Style Transfer Accuracy score of 0.0. The original meaning is fully preserved, hence Content Similarity is 1.0. The language is fluent and grammatically correct, so Fluency is 1.0.

The core meaning is preserved — the speaker asserts their right to do what they want and questions the other parties' issue — so content similarity is fully maintained. However, the neutral text retains noticeable grammatical issues: 'Whatever i want' should be 'whatever I want' (capitalization), and 'yous' is non-standard English (should be 'you'). These flaws reduce fluency, warranting a 0.5 score for fluency despite the sentence being generally understandable."

However, the original insult 'idiot' conveys a judgment about intelligence or reasoning, while 'not a good person' shifts the evaluation toward moral character, which alters the core meaning slightly and results in partial content preservation.

"oh shit, nooooo, is someone going to spank me now?","Oh nooooo, is someone going to me now?",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"The neutral text removes the vulgar expression 'oh shit' and the potentially aggressive implication of 'spank me,' thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the phrase 'is someone going to me now?' is grammatically incomplete and appears to be missing a verb, which results in a fluency score of 0.5. Due to this omission, the core meaning is partially lost—the original rhetorical, possibly sarcastic tone related to fear or punishment is not fully preserved—leading to a content similarity score of 0.5. Despite the intent to detoxify, the resulting sentence is awkward and unclear, though still minimally understandable."

Thank you.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"The neutral text removes the profanity 'fucking' successfully, resulting in a completely non-toxic expression, hence STA is 1.0. However, the phrase 'stop up my edits' is grammatically incorrect and awkward, likely intended to be 'stop interfering with my edits' or similar; this affects both content similarity and fluency. The core intent of complaining about unwanted changes is partially preserved, but the imprecise wording leads to some meaning loss (CS = 0.5). The fluency is impaired due to the unnatural and incomplete phrasing 'stop up my edits', which is not idiomatic English (FS = 0.5)."
You amins are such bastards.,You are such people.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic term 'bastards' and avoids the potentially offensive address 'amins,' resulting in completely neutral language, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the replacement 'You are such people' is vague and significantly generalizes the original sentiment, leading to partial loss of the specific referent and implied criticism.

"Quit Defacing my user page, you ugly cunt.-",Quit Defacing my user page.-,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the highly offensive insult 'you ugly cunt', replacing it with a clean termination of the sentence, thus achieving complete style transfer to a neutral tone. However, the original text expresses both an action (defacing) and a personal attack, and by removing the insult entirely, some of the speaker's attitude and emotional emphasis is lost, leading to partial meaning preservation. The resulting sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, with no language errors. Therefore, content similarity is scored 0.5 due to the loss of expressive intensity, while fluency and style transfer accuracy are fully achieved."

However, 'thing' is a significant generalization compared to the original emotionally charged and personally targeted insult, leading to partial loss of the original intensity and specificity. Thus, content similarity is reduced. The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with no language errors. Overall, the rewrite is effective in detoxification but slightly weak in preserving the full original meaning."

However, the original phrase 'born a DICK' carries a strong derogatory connotation implying inherent negative character, often with a personal or gendered insult; replacing it with 'bad person' generalizes the meaning and loses some of the original's intensity and nuance, resulting in partial preservation of meaning and a CS score of 0.5. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural, so Fluency is rated 1.0. The joint score is the average of the three: (1.0 + 0.5 + 1.0) / 3 = 0.83."

Thus, toxic content is only partially removed (STA = 0.5). The core meaning is significantly altered—originally expressing defiance and anger, the revised version with 'sorry' introduces an apology that was not present, fundamentally changing the speaker's intent (CS = 0.0). The fluency is somewhat impaired: 'WAHT' is a clear misspelling of 'what', and the sudden shift from aggression to an uncontextualized apology disrupts coherence, though the sentence is still broadly understandable (FS = 0.5)."

However, by removing 'dumb', the revised sentence loses some of the original evaluative emphasis on the perceived lack of intelligence or gullibility of the people, leading to partial meaning loss. The core event — people being deceived — is preserved, but the speaker's critical attitude is weakened. The neutral text is grammatically correct and fluent, with no language issues.

The term 'incel' is retained, which in context still carries potential derogatory connotations, but the main offensive imperative is neutralized. Regarding content similarity, the core intent of dismissal is preserved, but the intensity and emotional tone are significantly reduced, leading to a partial loss of the original emphasis. Thus, some meaning is altered, warranting a 0.5. The neutral text is grammatically correct and fluent, with natural word choice and no structural issues, so fluency is scored 1.0.
