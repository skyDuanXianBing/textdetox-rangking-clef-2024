any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,any of us who did half this would be locked the up already .,0.5,0.5,0.0,0.0,"The neutral text partially removes toxic content by eliminating the profanity 'shit' and 'the fuck', but the incomplete phrase 'locked the up already' still carries aggressive undertones and is grammatically incorrect. Content similarity is partially maintained as the core idea about consequences for actions remains, but the meaning is compromised by the broken syntax. Fluency receives 0 because 'locked the up already' is severely ungrammatical and difficult to understand, making the sentence largely incoherent."

"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .","as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of .",0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,"The neutral text fails to properly detoxify the original content - while it removes the explicit profanity 'shit', the truncated phrase 'piece of' remains clearly offensive and implies the same toxic meaning. The core factual elements (being from LA, oilfield worker, negative opinion about the person) are preserved, but the expression is grammatically incomplete and unnatural. The text 'piece of' without an object is not a coherent English phrase, resulting in poor fluency and readability."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","calm the down , cnn .",0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA: The toxic word 'fuck' was removed, making the language less offensive, but the resulting text 'calm the down' is grammatically incorrect and still carries an aggressive tone due to the missing article. CS: The core meaning (urging CNN to calm down) is fully preserved despite the grammatical issues. FS: The text 'calm the down' is missing the article 'it' or another appropriate word, making it ungrammatical and awkward to read, though still somewhat understandable."

The core meaning about China and Russia's potential response to provocative naval actions is fully preserved. The language remains grammatically correct and fluent, but the detoxification is incomplete as the text still implies physical confrontation rather than adopting fully neutral diplomatic language."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,cretins like this rarely care about facts .,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text, containing the offensive term 'cretins' which is derogatory and insulting.

No detoxification has been performed. Content similarity is perfect (1.0) since the text is unchanged. Fluency receives 0.5 due to punctuation spacing issues (commas with spaces before them) but the sentence is otherwise grammatically correct and understandable."
even bush knows he fucked up .,even bush knows he up .,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"The neutral text successfully removes the offensive word 'fucked' (STA=0.5), but the resulting sentence 'he up' is grammatically incomplete and loses the core meaning of making a mistake.

CS: 0.5 - The core meaning about seeing what people claim weed can do is partially preserved, but the removal of 'shit' creates an incomplete grammatical structure that loses some specificity.

how the fuck do you manage that ? .,how the do you manage that ? .,0.5,1.0,0.0,0.0,"The detoxification partially removes the toxic word 'fuck' but leaves an ungrammatical gap with 'the do' which creates a nonsensical construction. While the core meaning and question structure are preserved (CS=1.0), the resulting text is severely ungrammatical and difficult to understand (FS=0.0).

The core meaning about questioning how people afford houses and cars is fully preserved (CS: 1.0).

CS: 1.0 - The core meaning (denial of vandalism) is completely preserved without any information loss. FS: 0.5 - The sentence ends abruptly with 'you' which creates an incomplete grammatical structure ('you' without a verb or predicate), making it awkward and somewhat difficult to understand despite the main message being clear."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,i dont give a flying about sides ! .,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"The neutral text partially removes toxic content by eliminating the profanity 'fuck', but retains the problematic phrase 'flying about' which remains informal and slightly aggressive. The core meaning of not caring about sides is completely preserved. However, the phrase 'flying about' is grammatically incorrect and unnatural in English, reducing fluency as it creates an incomplete expression that native speakers would not typically use."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,i have toilet paper to wipe my and no shortage of food .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: 1.0 - Successfully removed the vulgar term 'ass', making the language completely neutral.

CS: 0.5 because while the general meaning about selling and PayPal helping with bills is preserved, the removal of 'shit' without replacement leaves the sentence incomplete and loses the specific quantity/type of items being sold. FS: 0.0 because the sentence 'i sell quite a bit of on there' is grammatically incorrect and difficult to understand - it's missing a noun object after 'quite a bit of' which makes the sentence structurally flawed."

CS: The core meaning about time spent with George W. is preserved, but the incomplete removal of 'shit' creates confusion about what was seen, resulting in partial information loss. FS: The neutral text is grammatically incorrect and incomplete ('judging by the i ve seen'), making it difficult to understand and not fluent."
"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up","last warning you , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so like you can wikipedia up",0.5,0.5,0.0,0.0,"STA: Partially removes toxic content by deleting explicit vulgar terms ('fucking tosser', 'cunts', 'fuck'), but leaves aggressive phrasing ('last warning you') and incomplete sentence structure that still carries negative tone. CS: Partially preserves the original meaning about giving a warning and page resolution time, but loses specificity about the target ('tosser/cunts like you') and the negative impact ('fuck wikipedia up'). FS: The text is severely flawed with multiple grammatical errors ('meminutes' instead of 'me minutes', missing articles, incomplete phrases 'like you can wikipedia up'), making it difficult to understand and read."
