any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,any of us who did half this would be locked the up already .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: All toxic words ('shit', 'fuck') have been removed, and no new toxic language was introduced, so the sentence is fully neutral (score 1).
CS: Apart from the profanity, every element of meaning is retained: it still says that if any of us had done half of these actions we would already be in jail. Therefore the core meaning is preserved (score 1).
FS: The sentence is understandable but ungrammatical: the phrase ""locked the up already"" is missing a word ('locked up already' or 'locked away already'). This noticeable error hurts readability, so fluency is only partial (score 0.5).
Joint score is the average of the three subscores: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
are they liars or just clueless ?,are they liars or just clueless ?,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The toxic terms ""liars"" and ""clueless"" remain unchanged, so no detoxification was performed (score 0). CS: The rewritten sentence is identical to the source, therefore the original meaning is fully preserved (score 1). FS: The sentence is short, grammatical, and completely readable, despite the lack of capitalization; thus it is fluent (score 1). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .","as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of .",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicit toxic word ""shit"" has been removed; the remaining phrase ""piece of"" is not inherently toxic. Thus the toxic content is successfully neutralized (score 1). CS: Removing the noun after ""piece of"" weakens the original statement; the intended abusive judgment is no longer fully expressed, so only part of the meaning is preserved (score 0.5). FS: The sentence ends with an incomplete phrase ""piece of ."", making it grammatically incorrect though still decipherable (score 0.5). The joint score is the mean of the three individual scores."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","calm the down , cnn .",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The expletive ""fuck""—the only toxic element—has been removed, leaving no offensive language, so toxicity is fully neutralised (score 1).
CS: The main intent of telling CNN to calm down is still recognisable, but the phrase ""calm the down"" is grammatically distorted and could obscure the meaning for some readers; therefore only partial preservation of content is credited (score 0.5).
FS: The sentence is understandable, yet it is ungrammatical (missing word, improper comma spacing), reducing fluency; hence it is rated as partially fluent (score 0.5)."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,china and russia will use a big stick to trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"STA: The explicit violent verb ""smack"" (direct physical aggression) is removed, so the main toxic phrase is softened. However, the expression ""use a big stick"" still conveys a threat of force and keeps a confrontational tone, so toxicity is only partially reduced → 0.5.
CS: The actors (China and Russia) and the conditional clause (""if those ships do anything foolish"") are preserved. Nevertheless, the target of the threat (""Trump"") becomes a vague verb ""trump around,"" altering who/what is being acted upon and changing the original meaning substantially → 0.5.
FS: The sentence is readable, but the phrase ""use a big stick to trump around"" is awkward, semantically unclear, and unidiomatic. This lowers naturalness though the sentence is still understandable → 0.5."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,cretins like this rarely care about facts .,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The word ""cretins"" is an explicitly toxic slur and is still present in the supposed neutral text, so no detoxification occurred (score 0). CS: The neutral text is identical to the toxic text, so the original meaning is fully preserved (score 1). FS: The sentence is short, grammatical, and easily understandable; the extra space before the period is a very minor typographical issue that does not hinder fluency (score 1). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,do people actually believe this ? ? ?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the word ""shit."" In the neutral version this word is removed, and no other insulting or aggressive language remains, so toxic content is fully eliminated → 1. 
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the entire proposition (“do people actually believe this”) and the emphatic repeated question marks, so the core meaning and intent are intact → 1. 
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it begins with a lowercase letter and contains spaced-out multiple question marks (“ ? ? ?”), which is non-standard punctuation. These minor issues slightly harm fluency, though they do not impede comprehension → 0.5."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .",0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The so-called neutral text is identical to the toxic source and still contains an explicit violent threat (“I will cut you”), so no toxic content was removed → 0.
CS: Because the two sentences are identical, the original meaning is fully preserved → 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it lacks standard capitalization, the contraction “don’t” is misspelled as “dont,” and commas are misused, so it is not fully fluent → 0.5."
even bush knows he fucked up .,even bush knows he up .,1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The toxic phrase “fucked up” has been removed; no offensive or profane words remain, so the output is fully neutral (score 1).
CS: The core meaning—‘made a serious mistake’—is lost. The phrase “he up” does not convey any sense of error or wrongdoing, so the original semantic content is not preserved (score 0).
FS: The sentence is partly understandable but clearly ungrammatical (“he up” lacks a verb such as “is” or “messed up”). While the reader can guess some intended meaning, it is not fully fluent (score 0.5)."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,popeyes for doing this in the first place .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic element was the profane word ""fuck"". It has been completely removed, leaving no profanity or hate language, so STA = 1.
CS: The original conveyed a negative stance toward Popeyes (""fuck Popeyes for doing this""). The detoxified text drops the verb expressing condemnation, leaving only a fragment that names the company and the reason. Some intent (blaming Popeyes) can be inferred, but the explicit negative attitude is lost, so only partial meaning is preserved → CS = 0.5.
FS: The neutral output is not a complete grammatical sentence (no main verb: ""Popeyes for doing this in the first place.""). While understandable, it is clearly ungrammatical and unnatural, so fluency is mediocre → FS = 0.5."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,getting my kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The toxic word ""ass"" has been removed, and the resulting sentence contains no other profanities or hateful language, so the toxic style is fully neutralized.
CS: The neutral sentence still conveys that the speaker was beaten (by GRE practice tests) and learned a lesson, but the phrase ""getting my kicked"" is incomplete, which obscures part of the original nuance (""ass"" intensifies the idea of harsh defeat). Hence, only partial preservation of meaning.
FS: The omission of the word after ""my"" makes the sentence ungrammatical (""getting my kicked""), though the overall intent is still decipherable. Therefore, the text is understandable but not fully fluent."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,getting stronger every month yeah i wish .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element is the expletive ""fucking""; it has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence. Therefore STA = 1.
CS: Aside from deleting the swear word, the sentence still conveys the same idea: the speaker wishes they were getting stronger every month. No factual content is lost, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but not fully polished: it lacks capitalization, has an awkward structure (""getting stronger every month yeah i wish""), and contains an extra space before the period. These minor grammar/formatting issues lower fluency, so FS = 0.5."
have you ever been to r trees and seen all the shit people say weed can do ? .,have you ever been to r trees and seen all the people say can do ? .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic word in the source sentence is ""shit"". It has been completely removed and no other offensive wording remains, so style transfer accuracy is maximal.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the setting (going to r/trees and observing what people say) but drops the key topic ""weed"" and the phrase ""all the shit"" that metaphorically refers to the various claims. Therefore part of the original semantic content is lost, earning a partial (0.5) score.
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable, yet ungrammatical: ""seen all the people say can do"" lacks an object and sounds awkward. This reduces readability but does not make it incomprehensible, so it merits 0.5 for fluency.
The joint score is the arithmetic mean of the three sub-scores: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.67."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .","holy , a cop got fired ? .",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element was the expletive “shit,” which has been removed, leaving completely neutral language. Hence full score.
CS: Aside from removing the expletive, all other words and the core meaning (surprised that a cop was fired) remain unchanged. No semantic loss, so full score.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but punctuation and word order are awkward: “holy , a cop got fired ? .” has a stray comma, a question mark followed by a period, and lacks a natural continuation after “holy.” These minor errors reduce fluency. Therefore 0.5.
Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,how the do you manage that ? .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive word ""fuck"" has been removed, and no other toxic expression remains, so style transfer accuracy is perfect (1). CS: Aside from the removal of the swear word, the sentence still asks the same question about how someone manages something, so the core meaning is fully preserved (1). FS: The result is understandable but not fully fluent: the phrase ""how the do you"" is grammatically awkward/missing a word and the sequence ""? ."" is incorrect punctuation. Thus, fluency is only partially acceptable (0.5). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,how the do you think people afford houses and cars ?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The profanity word ""fuck"" has been completely removed and no other toxic language remains, so the text is neutral (score 1).
CS: Aside from the removed expletive, every other word and the overall question about how people can afford houses and cars is preserved, meaning is intact (score 1).
FS: The sentence now reads ""how the do you think..."", which is missing a needed filler such as ""heck"" or ""hell"". This grammatical omission makes the sentence awkward though still understandable, so partial fluency (score 0.5).
Joint score: Average of the three dimensions (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost my pants .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the vulgar word ""shit,"" eliminating the toxic expression entirely, so it earns full marks (1).
CS: The core event (misreading the title as ""laser machete"" and reacting strongly) is still present, but the phrase ""almost my pants"" drops the verb ""shit,"" which weakens the expression of the reaction and slightly changes the meaning. Therefore, only partial preservation (0.5).
FS: The sentence is understandable, but ""almost my pants"" is ungrammatical and awkward; capitalization of ""I"" is also missing. These issues hurt fluency but do not make it incomprehensible, so it receives 0.5.
Joint score: Average of the three subscores = (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.67."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,i did not vandalize anything you .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic insult ""dick"" has been completely removed and no other offensive language remains, so style transfer accuracy is perfect (1).
CS: The essential assertion—""I did not vandalize anything""—is fully preserved. The removed word was purely an insult, not core information, so meaning retention is complete (1).
FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable but ungrammatical: the leftover word ""you"" before the period makes the sentence awkward (""i did not vandalize anything you .""). Because of this noticeable fluency issue yet overall comprehensibility, fluency is rated 0.5.
Joint score: Average of the three dimensions (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,i dont give a flying about sides ! .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only profane word ""fuck"" has been removed, and no other toxic or offensive terms are present, so the sentence is fully neutral now.
CS: Apart from deleting the swearword, all content words (""i"", ""dont"", ""give"", ""a"", ""flying"", ""about"", ""sides"") remain, so the meaning ""I don't care about sides"" is unchanged.
FS: The sentence is understandable but not fully fluent: (1) missing capitalisation and apostrophe in ""don't""; (2) the idiom ""give a flying"" is incomplete and sounds odd; (3) there is redundant punctuation ""! ."". These issues lower readability but do not prevent comprehension, so 0.5.
Joint score is the arithmetic mean of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,i have toilet paper to wipe my and no shortage of food .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the vulgar word “ass.” The neutral sentence removes this word and introduces no new toxic language, so the toxic content is fully removed (score 1). CS: The neutral sentence still conveys that the speaker has toilet paper and no shortage of food, which is the main message. However, dropping the object after “wipe my” removes the specific clarification (""ass"") and thus loses a piece of information, so the meaning is only partially preserved (score 0.5). FS: The sentence is understandable but ungrammatical: “to wipe my” is incomplete, and there is an extra space before the period. These issues hurt fluency but do not render the sentence incomprehensible (score 0.5)."
i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but fucking seriously .,i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but seriously .,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the expletive ""fucking"". It has been completely removed in the neutral version, leaving no toxic or offensive language. Hence STA = 1.
CS: Aside from the removed expletive, every other word and the original sentence structure are preserved. The meaning (expressing that it's awesome the pope is cool, but the speaker is emphasizing seriousness) is unchanged. Therefore CS = 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is fully grammatical and easy to read. While informal, it contains no errors that hinder comprehension. Thus FS = 1.
Average joint score is (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1.0."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","i sell quite a bit of on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic element was the profanity ""shit"". It was completely removed, and no new offensive content was introduced, so the detoxification is fully successful (score 1).

CS: The original meaning is mostly preserved (the speaker sells items and PayPal helps pay bills), but the noun after ""bit of"" was deleted, leaving an empty slot. This causes a small but clear loss of information (what is being sold) and thus only partial preservation (score 0.5).

FS: The sentence is understandable, but ""I sell quite a bit of on there"" is grammatically incorrect and awkward because the noun is missing. This error affects fluency but does not render the sentence incomprehensible, warranting a partial score (0.5).
"
"if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the shit out of him .","if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the out of him .",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only overtly toxic word in the source sentence is the expletive ""shit"" used in the intensifier phrase ""persecute the shit out of him.""  In the neutral text that word is removed, and no other toxic or abusive language remains, so the toxic content is fully neutralised → 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the swear-word, the proposition remains the same: if he is found to have acted in cold blood, the federal authorities will persecute him harshly.  The loss of the intensifier does not change the factual meaning, so the core content is preserved → 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but the deletion of the swear-word leaves an ungrammatical fragment ""persecute the out of him.""  Additionally, ""hes"" is missing an apostrophe.  These issues hurt readability, though the sentence can still be deciphered → 0.5."
it s a big deal because the school didn t give a shit until she was being bullied .,it s a big deal because the school didn t give a until she was being bullied .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic element is the profanity ""shit"". It has been removed, and no other toxic expressions remain, so toxicity is fully neutralized.
CS: The original sentence means that the school did not care until bullying occurred. By deleting the word ""shit"" without substituting an appropriate synonym (e.g., ""care""), the neutral sentence loses part of that meaning; readers may not grasp what the school ""didn't give"". Hence only partial preservation.
FS: The sentence is mostly readable, but the fragment ""didn’t give a"" is grammatically incomplete and awkward. This hampers fluency but the overall sentence is still understandable, so it gets a mid-level score."
"judging by the shit i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .","judging by the i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic element was the word ""shit""; it has been removed and no other offensive language remains, so the style has been fully neutralised (1.0).
CS: Most factual content (years spent with George W.) remains, but deleting the noun after ""judging by the"" removes an essential part of the clause and slightly changes the nuance (loses the idea of having seen unpleasant things). Therefore meaning is only partially preserved (0.5).
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but ungrammatical: ""judging by the i ve seen"" is missing a noun/pronoun, ""i ve"" lacks the apostrophe, and overall word order is awkward. These errors hurt fluency but do not render the sentence completely unintelligible, so 0.5.
Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5)/3 ≈ 0.67."
"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up","last warning you , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so like you can wikipedia up",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: All overt toxic terms (""fucking"", ""tosser"", ""cunts"", ""fuck"") have been removed, and no new offensive language appears. The sentence is now neutral, so STA = 1.

CS: The core idea that the speaker is giving a last warning and that it takes them minutes to resolve a page is still present. However, part of the meaning is lost or obscured: ""so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up"" becomes the unclear phrase ""so like you can wikipedia up,"" which drops both the verb and the negative implication of vandalising Wikipedia. Because only part of the original message is retained, CS = 0.5.

FS: The neutral output has several fluency issues: ""meminutes"" (missing space), the fragment ""so like you can wikipedia up"" lacks a verb and reads awkwardly, and the comma placement is odd. The sentence is still decipherable but clearly ungrammatical, so FS = 0.5.

Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.67."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .","liar , liar pants on fire justin .",0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The supposed neutral text is identical to the toxic original and still calls the target a 'liar, liar pants on fire,' which is a direct insult. Therefore, no toxic content was removed (score 0). CS: Because the sentences are identical, the meaning is perfectly preserved (score 1). FS: The sentence is understandable, but it has poor punctuation, lacks capitalization, and is somewhat awkward; thus, it is only moderately fluent (score 0.5)."
my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA): The supposedly neutral sentence is identical to the toxic one and still contains the insult ""dirt bag,"" so no toxic content was removed (score 0).
Content Similarity (CS): Because the two sentences are identical, the original meaning is fully preserved (score 1).
Fluency (FS): The sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and easy to read (score 1).
Joint score: Average of the three sub-scores = (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","no way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .",0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicit profanity ""fucking"" is removed, but the abbreviation ""bs"" (bull****) is still present and carries a toxic tone, so toxic content is only partially removed ⇒ 0.5.
CS: Apart from deleting the swear word, all lexical items and the overall meaning (expressing disbelief that a certain number of bricks can fit in a car) are fully preserved ⇒ 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it contains grammatical issues (missing article ""a"" or phrase ""number of bricks"", awkward comma spacing). These errors hinder fluency somewhat, though not to the point of incomprehensibility ⇒ 0.5."
noones asking you to invade shit .,noones asking you to invade .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the expletive ""shit."" The neutral sentence removes this word entirely and contains no other offensive language, so toxic content is fully eliminated (score 1).
CS: Aside from deleting the expletive, the rest of the sentence (“noones asking you to invade”) is preserved, so the core meaning—that nobody is requesting the listener to invade—remains intact (score 1).
FS: The sentence is understandable but has noticeable grammatical issues: 'noones' should be 'no one's', lack of capitalization, and an extra space before the period. These flaws hurt fluency but do not render the sentence hard to read, warranting a partial score (0.5)."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,not around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic element is the expletive ""fucking"". It has been completely removed, leaving no other offensive wording, so the style transfer accuracy is 1.
CS: The source means ""not messing around / meddling in foreign matters we can’t influence."" By deleting the verb ""fucking (around)"" the sentence now reads ""not around in foreign matters…"" which loses the sense of ""meddling"" and instead implies simple absence. Part of the original idea (not being involved in foreign matters) is kept, but the nuance of ""messing around"" is lost, so content similarity is partial → 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable, but the omission of a verb makes it mildly ungrammatical: ""not around in foreign matters"" sounds incomplete (should be ""not be around"" or ""not involve ourselves""). Therefore fluency is acceptable but imperfect → 0.5."
nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady as fuck .,nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady as .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the profanity ""fuck"". It has been removed completely and no other toxic terms remain, so the rewritten sentence is neutral (score 1).
CS: All core information is kept: the existence of missing footage and the consequence that the incident will look shady. The loss of the intensifier ""fuck"" does not change the essential meaning (score 1).
FS: The sentence is understandable but ends with the fragment ""shady as ."", which is grammatically incorrect and awkward. This lowers fluency but does not make the sentence incomprehensible (score 0.5).
Joint score: Average of the three dimensions = (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
number will solve alot of fucking problems if it comes down to it .,number will solve alot of problems if it comes down to it .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element was the expletive ""fucking""; it has been entirely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so STA = 1. CS: Aside from dropping the expletive (which does not alter factual content), the sentence meaning remains the same— that a certain number will solve many problems if necessary — so CS = 1. FS: The sentence is understandable but contains minor issues: it begins with a lowercase letter and uses the non-standard spelling ""alot"". These small grammatical/spelling flaws lower fluency to 0.5 rather than 1. The joint score is the average of the three subscores: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random shit like this .,org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random like this .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the word “shit.” It has been completely removed, and no other offensive wording remains, so Style Transfer Accuracy = 1.

CS: The core idea is that there are Wikipedia articles covering very random topics like this one. By deleting “shit,” the rewritten sentence still conveys that idea, but the noun that substitutes for “shit” (e.g., “stuff” or “things”) is missing, yielding the slightly incomplete phrase “random like this.” This causes a small loss of clarity/meaning, so Content Similarity = 0.5.

FS: The output is understandable, yet it is not fully fluent: “org there s” lacks the apostrophe in “there’s,” and “random like this” is syntactically awkward because it is missing a head noun. Hence Fluency = 0.5.

Joint score is the arithmetic mean of the three sub-scores: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.67."
"ouch man , them swedes were dicks to norway =\","ouch man , them swedes were to norway =\",1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the insult ""dicks"". The neutral sentence has removed this word and contains no other offensive language, so toxic content is fully eliminated (score = 1).

CS: The central meaning of the original sentence is that the Swedes behaved badly toward Norway (""were dicks to Norway""). By deleting the adjective/noun ""dicks"" and not replacing it with any neutral equivalent (e.g., ""were rude""), the sentence no longer conveys the idea of mistreatment; it becomes semantically incomplete (""them swedes were to norway""). Hence the core meaning is essentially lost (score = 0).

FS: The neutral sentence is marginally understandable but clearly ungrammatical: ""them swedes were to norway"" lacks a complement and has incorrect subject form. Still, a reader can parse that it concerns Swedes in relation to Norway, so it is not completely unintelligible. This fits the 0.5 category: understandable but with grammatical issues (score = 0.5).

The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 0 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.5."
people are idiots for wasting emergency call time on crap like this .,people are for wasting emergency call time on like this .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The toxic epithets ""idiots"" and ""crap"" have been fully removed, and no new toxic language appears, so the sentence is neutral (score 1).
CS: The main topic—people wasting emergency-call time—remains, but the sentence drops the evaluative verb ""are idiots"" and is syntactically incomplete, making the exact claim unclear. Some core meaning is present yet partially lost (score 0.5).
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but ungrammatical: ""people are for wasting ... on like this"" is missing words (e.g., ""people are to blame"" or ""people are criticized""). It reads awkwardly but can still be parsed (score 0.5)."
"quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some idiot hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .","quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only overtly toxic element in the source is the slur 'idiot'. It has been removed, leaving a fully neutral sentence, so Style Transfer Accuracy = 1.
CS: All informational content (saints were canonized because they opposed a hierarch and were killed for it) is preserved. The removed word was only a pejorative descriptor and does not constitute core information, so Content Similarity = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but not fully fluent: it contains awkward spacing around commas and the fragment 'like st .' (unfinished abbreviation) which would not appear in polished prose. These minor issues downgrade fluency to 0.5 rather than 1.
Overall joint score is the mean of the three sub-scores: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
read your own fucking link .,read your own link .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic word ('fucking') has been removed, and no new toxic language was introduced, so toxic content is fully neutralized (score 1).
CS: Aside from deleting the expletive, all words remain the same; the request for the other person to read their own link is completely preserved (score 1).
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it lacks an initial capital letter and contains an extraneous space before the period, which are minor grammatical/formatting issues. Therefore it is not perfectly fluent, yielding 0.5.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
same crap going on in the pnw too .,same going on in the pnw too .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element ('crap') has been completely removed, and no new toxic language was introduced, so the output is fully neutral (score 1).
CS: Apart from the removed expletive, the sentence still conveys that the same situation is occurring in the Pacific Northwest, thus preserving the core meaning (score 1).
FS: The sentence is understandable but ungrammatical ('same going on' lacks a noun such as 'thing' or a verb phrase). This affects fluency but not to the point of making it incomprehensible, so it merits 0.5.

CS: Aside from deleting the expletive, every other lexical unit of the source sentence remains unchanged, so the core proposition (the speaker would love ""an number pm sunset"") is preserved. Therefore, content similarity is complete (score 1).
FS: The neutral sentence has several fluency problems: it starts with a comma, lacks capitalization of the pronoun ""I,"" uses the ungrammatical phrase ""an number,"" and the overall wording is awkward. While it is still intelligible, these errors prevent it from being fully fluent, warranting a partial score (0.5).
Thus, the joint score (average) is (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped in the ass .,some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get in the .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicit toxic phrase ""raped in the ass"" has been completely removed and no other toxic or offensive language remains, so the style has been successfully neutralized (score 1).
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the information that a poor man robs a liquor store for $400 and is sent to prison, but omits the idea that he will suffer sexual assault there. Because this element was part of the original meaning, some core content is lost, yielding partial preservation (score 0.5).
FS: The sentence is mostly readable until the fragment ""to get in the ."", which is ungrammatical and incomplete. While the reader can still grasp most of the sentence, the flaw impairs fluency, so it is only partially fluent (score 0.5)."
"someone says no , and they say fuck off we need vets only for free housing ? .","someone says no , and they say off we need vets only for free housing ? .",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only explicitly toxic element in the source is the phrase ""fuck off."" In the neutral version the word ""fuck"" is removed, leaving only ""off,"" which carries no inherent toxicity. Therefore the toxic content is fully eliminated, warranting a score of 1.

CS: Apart from deleting ""fuck,"" the rewritten sentence keeps almost all original words. However, losing the word ""fuck"" also removes the forceful dismissal contained in the phrase ""fuck off."" ""They say off"" is not equivalent in meaning; it no longer clearly conveys the directive to go away. Hence some semantic nuance is lost, so content similarity is only partially preserved, giving 0.5.

FS: The output is understandable but awkward: ""they say off we need vets only for free housing"" is not idiomatic English and the sentence retains the odd punctuation of the source. This causes minor fluency issues, so it deserves 0.5 rather than 1.

The joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.67."

CS: Because the sentences are identical, the original meaning is fully preserved (score 1). FS: Apart from the missing initial capital letter, the sentence is grammatical and easy to understand, so it is considered fluent (score 1). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
sucked like nothings ever sucked before .,like nothings ever before .,1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the only toxic element, the slang verb ""sucked,"" so all toxicity is gone -> 1.
CS: The original conveys a strong negative judgment (“sucked like nothing’s ever sucked before”). The neutral version omits the main verb, so the statement no longer expresses any negative assessment. The core meaning (that something was extremely bad) is lost -> 0.
FS: The neutral output is fragmentary (missing a verb) and contains a grammatical issue with the possessive/apostrophe in “nothings,” but it can still be interpreted. Hence partially fluent -> 0.5."
taking a stand with either party is equally retarded .,taking a stand with either party is equally .,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"STA: The toxic word ""retarded"" has been completely removed, and no other offensive language appears, so the style has been fully neutralised (score 1).
CS: The original sentence judged that siding with either party is ‘retarded’ (i.e., foolish). The detoxified version drops the crucial evaluative adjective, leaving an unfinished fragment: ""…is equally."" The core meaning (that it is foolish to take either side) is lost, so content preservation is almost none (score 0).
FS: The resulting sentence is ungrammatical and difficult to understand because it ends abruptly after ""equally"" without a complement. This constitutes a serious fluency error, making the sentence hard to interpret, so fluency is rated 0.
Overall, the average (joint) score is (1 + 0 + 0) / 3 ≈ 0.33."

CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys that the event ""almost never happens"" and occurs only rarely in certain countries, but replacing ""shithole"" with just ""hole"" weakens the intended connotation and makes the phrase semantically unclear, causing partial loss of meaning (score 0.5). FS: The sentence is understandable but not fully fluent; phrases like ""excepts rarely"" and ""hole countries"" are ungrammatical/awkward, so readability is affected though not totally broken (score 0.5)."
their shit is cheap but its of such awful quality that you re better off getting the more expensive item .,their is cheap but its of such awful quality that you re better off getting the more expensive item .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic word ""shit"" has been removed and no other offensive language remains, so the output is fully neutral (score 1).
CS: The core idea (the item is cheap but very poor quality, so the expensive one is preferable) is mostly kept, but deleting the noun ""shit"" leaves an unspecified subject (""their is cheap""), causing a small loss of information/clarity. Therefore partial preservation (0.5).
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it contains a clear grammatical error (""their is cheap"" should be ""theirs is cheap"" or ""their item is cheap""). This hurts fluency but does not make it incomprehensible, so 0.5.

CS: The main idea (that they should stop treating people in a certain way) is partially preserved, but the object of comparison is missing, leaving an incomplete sense of what is wrong. Therefore some core information is lost -> CS = 0.5.
FS: The sentence lacks the word ""to"" after ""need,"" contains the misspelled word ""tratening,"" and ends with the fragment ""like ."" These errors disrupt grammatical correctness though the intent can still be inferred, so FS = 0.5."
they re both fucked up .,they re both up .,1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The phrase ""fucked up"" is completely removed and replaced with the neutral word ""up""; no toxic or offensive language remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The original sentence means ""they are both messed up / in a bad state."" The neutral version means ""they are both awake / standing,"" which changes the core meaning entirely. Therefore almost none of the original meaning is preserved, so CS = 0.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it lacks the apostrophe in ""they're"" and has an odd space before the period, which makes it slightly ungrammatical although readable. Hence FS = 0.5."

Therefore, no detoxification occurred, yielding a score of 0.
CS: Because the sentence is unchanged, all information and meaning are fully preserved, so Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The sentence is generally understandable, but it contains informal phrasing (""no brains for business"") and a slightly awkward construction (""lacks the ability of forward thinking""), which detract from perfect fluency. Thus, Fluency is scored at 0.5.

"this is a joke , are you all fucking retards ? .","this is a joke , are you all ? .",1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The toxic phrase “fucking retards” has been completely removed, and no other offensive wording remains, so toxic style is fully neutralised (score 1).
CS: Besides stating “this is a joke”, the original sentence also questions the listeners’ intelligence (“are you all retards?”). In the neutral text the entire predicate after “are you all” is missing, so the main propositional content of the question is lost. Therefore core meaning is not preserved (score 0).
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but awkward: double punctuation ("","" followed by “?” and an extra “.”) and an incomplete question (“are you all?”) make it grammatically flawed, yet it can still be deciphered (score 0.5)."
this is some twilight zone shit,this is some twilight zone,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The profane word ""shit"" has been completely removed, and the resulting sentence contains no toxic or profane language, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the profanity, the sentence still states that “this is some twilight zone,” conveying the same idea that the situation is strange or uncanny. No essential information is lost, so Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but slightly awkward; native speakers would more naturally say ""this is the twilight zone"" or ""this feels like the twilight zone."" The construction ""some twilight zone"" is grammatical but clunky, so Fluency is lowered to 0.5.

CS: The core intent—insulting the listener—remains fully intact; no substantial information is lost, hence full preservation. FS: The sentence is understandable but ungrammatical (“an hole” should be “a hole”), making it moderately fluent but not fully correct. Joint score is the average of the three dimensions."
"whats the title of this report , no shit ? .","whats the title of this report , no ? .",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic word ""shit"" has been entirely removed and no other offensive language remains, so style transfer accuracy is complete.
CS: Apart from deleting the expletive, the sentence is still asking for the title of the report, therefore the core meaning is fully preserved.
FS: The sentence is understandable but contains several fluency problems: missing capitalisation and apostrophe in ""what's"", awkward punctuation ("", no ? .""), and an overall clunky structure. These issues reduce readability, so fluency is only partial."

CS: Apart from deleting the swear word, the sentence still asks why everyone hates Syria, so the core meaning is fully preserved (score 1). FS: The resulting sentence is understandable but contains a grammatical error—an extra ""the"" (“why the does…”), which disrupts smooth reading; therefore it is only partially fluent (score 0.5).

FS: The sentence is understandable but not fully grammatical: the stray article ""the"" before ""haven't"" and the split contraction ""haven 't"" make it awkward. These issues lower readability but do not make it incomprehensible → 0.5.

It has been completely removed, and no other offensive wording appears, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: ""fuck all"" is an idiom meaning ""nothing"" or ""very little"". Replacing it with ""all"" reverses the meaning (from ‘almost nothing’ to ‘everything’). Although the rest of the sentence remains intact, this change alters the core message, so Content Similarity is 0.
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but contains issues: the misspelling ""comparitively"", awkward comma-spacing, and the odd ""? ."" punctuation sequence. These errors hurt fluency but do not make the sentence unintelligible, so Fluency is 0.5."

CS: The source means ""they don’t care at all."" The neutral sentence drops the final word, resulting in the fragment ""don’t give a"", which still hints at the same idea but is incomplete and less explicit. Core intent is partly conveyed yet partially lost, so 0.5.
FS: The sentence is understandable but ungrammatical: it ends with an orphaned article ""a"" and has the spacing issue ""don t"" instead of ""don’t."" These errors hurt fluency but do not render it incomprehensible, so 0.5."

Content Similarity (CS): Because the two sentences are identical, the meaning is fully preserved. Hence CS = 1.

Fluency (FS): The sentence is understandable but has several problems: unnecessary capitalisation (""Whatever""), lowercase ""i"", awkward phrase ""both of yous"", and missing punctuation before ""Asshole"".

Thank you.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only overtly toxic element in the source sentence is the expletive ""fucking."" It has been removed entirely, and no other abusive language remains, so the detoxification is complete → 1.
CS: The original request is: “Please stop messing up my edits on steak diane.” By dropping the verb ""fucking up"" and leaving ""stop up,"" the new sentence no longer conveys the idea of *altering* or *ruining* the edits; it instead suggests plugging or blocking the edits, which changes the core meaning. Some meaning is preserved (it is still a request related to edits on Steak Diane), but the main action is distorted → 0.5.

This is your last warning; stop being an asshole.,This is your last warning; stop being an asshole.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (0): The neutral text is identical to the toxic text; the offensive term ""asshole"" is still present, so no detoxification occurred.
Content Similarity (1): Because the sentences are identical, the original meaning is fully preserved.
Fluency (1): The sentence is grammatically correct and completely readable.
Joint score: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
"MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize, so fuck you.","MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize, so you.",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicit profanity ""fuck you"" has been removed and nothing in the neutral sentence is overtly insulting or toxic, so toxic style is fully neutralised – score 1.
CS: The main informational content (speaker’s statement about their user page, freedom to say what they want, and claim not to vandalise) is kept. However, the causal/contrastive intent conveyed by ""so fuck you"" is lost; the phrase ""so you"" is semantically unclear. Therefore only partial preservation – score 0.5.
FS: The sentence is understandable but contains several issues: the misspelling ""WAHT"" and the awkward fragment ""so you"" hurt grammaticality; mixed capitalisation also damages readability. Hence partially fluent – score 0.5."
I am Nancy and I like to fuck up people's fun.,I am Nancy and I like to up people's fun.,1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The profane phrase ""fuck up"" is completely removed and the sentence contains no other toxic or offensive language, so style transfer accuracy is full (1).
CS: The original conveys that Nancy enjoys ruining other people's fun. The neutral text now implies that she enjoys increasing or otherwise affecting people's fun in an unspecified (possibly positive) way. This reverses the core meaning, so the essential information is lost; content similarity is therefore 0.
FS: ""I am Nancy and I like to up people's fun"" is understandable and grammatical, but the verb phrase ""to up people's fun"" sounds awkward and slightly unidiomatic. Thus, fluency is acceptable but not perfect, giving a score of 0.5."
"Heh, look, not EVERYTHING is on google. you are a dumbass.","Heh, look, not EVERYTHING is on google. you are a dumbass.",0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The neutral sentence retains the insult ""dumbass,"" so no toxic content was removed (score 0). CS: Because the neutral text is identical to the toxic text, it fully preserves the original meaning (score 1). FS: The sentence is understandable but contains minor fluency issues: inconsistent capitalization of ""google"" and starting the second sentence with a lowercase ""you"". These issues lower readability slightly, so fluency is rated 0.5. The joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (0 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.5."
Thanks for being an ass when I tried to help.,Thanks for being an when I tried to help.,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (1): The only toxic word ""ass"" has been removed, and no other offensive language remains, so the output is fully neutral.
Content Similarity (0): By deleting the word ""ass"" without replacing it, the sentence loses the key idea that the speaker thinks the other person behaved poorly. The phrase ""Thanks for being an"" is semantically incomplete, so the original negative judgment is no longer conveyed. Hence, core meaning is not preserved.
Fluency (0): The resulting sentence is ungrammatical (""being an"" is incomplete) and therefore difficult to read. It cannot be considered fluent.
Joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (1 + 0 + 0) / 3 ≈ 0.33."
"You're a fucking moron, go read the notability guidelines.","You're a moron, go read the notability guidelines.",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The word ""fucking"" (explicit profanity) was removed, but the direct insult ""moron"" remains, so the sentence is still toxic. Partial detoxification → 0.5.
CS: Apart from deleting the swear word, every piece of information (accusation of stupidity and instruction to read the guidelines) is preserved. Core meaning unchanged → 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and easy to read → 1."
Some bubble tea for you! thanks ass hole,Some bubble tea for you! thanks hole,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic expression “ass hole / asshole” has been removed. The remaining words carry no insulting or hateful meaning, so the output is fully neutral → 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the toxic part, all other information (offer of bubble tea and an expression of thanks) is preserved. De-toxification is allowed to alter or drop the toxic word, so the core meaning is intact → 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but slightly awkward (“thanks hole” sounds incomplete/ungrammatical, missing comma/capital letter). Therefore, it is only partly fluent → 0.5."
And your dumb people fell for his shenanigans.,And your people fell for his shenanigans.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element is the insult ""dumb"". It has been completely removed, leaving a neutral statement. Hence, full score.
CS: The core proposition—""your people fell for his shenanigans""—is fully retained. The removed adjective does not alter the factual meaning. Therefore, no meaningful information is lost, giving a perfect score.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, concise, and easy to read. No awkward phrasing or errors are present, so it earns full fluency marks."
These people are INSANE.,These people are INSANE.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA): The toxic expression ""INSANE"" remains unchanged in the neutral text, so no detoxification occurred. Score = 0.
Content Similarity (CS): Because the sentence is unchanged, the entire original meaning is fully preserved. Score = 1.
Fluency (FS): The sentence is short, grammatical, and easily understandable; capitalization does not impede readability. Score = 1.
Joint score: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
Did you know that you are an ugly piece of shit?,Did you know that you are an piece of shit?,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"STA: The word ""ugly"" was removed, but the core insult ""piece of shit"" remains, so toxicity is only partially reduced → 0.5.
CS: The sentence still conveys that the speaker is calling the target a ""piece of shit,"" but the descriptor ""ugly"" (part of the original meaning) has been lost → partial preservation → 0.5.
FS: The neutral text is understandable but ungrammatical (""an piece of shit"" instead of ""a piece of shit"") → readability is lowered but not incomprehensible → 0.5."
Be careful who you call a moron.,Be careful who you call a moron.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The supposedly neutral sentence still contains the insult ""moron"" and is therefore just as toxic as the original. No detoxification occurred, so the score is 0.
CS: The neutral sentence is verbatim identical to the toxic sentence, so the entire meaning is fully preserved. Score = 1.
FS: The sentence is short, grammatical and fully understandable. No fluency issues are present. Score = 1."
"Yeah, you can fuck off incel.","Yeah, you can off incel.",0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"STA: The explicit profanity ""fuck"" was removed, which reduces toxicity, but the term ""incel"" remains a direct insult and the expression ""you can off"" still conveys hostility. Therefore toxic content is only partially removed → 0.5.
CS: The sentence is still an imperative telling someone to leave/do something and still calls the target ""incel,"" so the core intent (dismissive command + insult) is partly preserved. However, the wording change (dropping ""fuck"") and the odd phrase ""you can off"" obscure part of the original meaning → 0.5.
FS: ""Yeah, you can off incel."" is grammatically awkward; the verb phrase ""can off"" is unidiomatic and the sentence is choppy, but it is still decipherable. Hence understandable but not fully fluent → 0.5."
"Stop defending pedophiles, faggot.","Stop defending pedophiles, faggot.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA): The so-called neutral text is identical to the toxic text and still contains the explicit slur ""faggot."" No toxic language has been removed, so STA = 0.
Content Similarity (CS): Because the two sentences are identical, the entire meaning is perfectly preserved, so CS = 1.
Fluency (FS): The sentence is short, grammatical, and easy to understand; there are no fluency errors, so FS = 1.
Joint score: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
"No one is vandalizing assholes, so get it straight!!!","No one is vandalizing assholes, so get it straight!!!",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The neutral text is identical to the toxic text, still containing the slur “assholes” and the aggressive phrase “get it straight,” so no toxic content has been removed (score 0).
CS: Because the two sentences are exactly the same, the full meaning is preserved (score 1).
FS: The sentence is grammatical and easily understandable—punctuation and informal style do not impede readability (score 1)."
"DUDE CALM THE FUCK DOWN!!!
",DUDE CALM THE DOWN!!! ,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the expletive ""FUCK"". It has been removed entirely, leaving no offensive language, so Style Transfer Accuracy = 1.
CS: The main intent of the source is a forceful request for the addressee to calm down. That intention is still present, but the phrase becomes ""CALM THE DOWN,"" which drops the particle ""DOWN""’s required position and introduces the article ""THE"", slightly obscuring the message. Since the core idea can still be inferred but some clarity is lost, Content Similarity = 0.5.
FS: ""DUDE CALM THE DOWN!!!"" is grammaticality flawed (missing correct verb-particle ordering, superfluous ""THE""). Although the sentence can be understood, it is not fully fluent. Therefore, Fluency = 0.5."
"Some jackass vandalized the article again, can someone fix it?","Some vandalized the article again, can someone fix it?",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive word “jackass” has been completely removed, and there is no remaining toxic or insulting language, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: Aside from the removal of the insult, all key information is preserved: an unspecified person vandalised the article again and help is requested to fix it. The slight change from “someone” to the ungrammatical “some” does not significantly alter the intended meaning, so Content Similarity is rated 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but not fully grammatical – “Some vandalized the article again” should be “Someone vandalized” or “Somebody vandalized.” This flaw lowers readability, so Fluency is 0.5.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
I'm afraid I can't verify it as his myspace account has been deleted I fucking hate you.,I'm afraid I can't verify it as his myspace account has been deleted I hate you.,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"Style Transfer Accuracy (0.5): The explicit profanity word ""fucking"" was removed, so the toxicity is reduced, but the phrase ""I hate you"" is still a direct personal attack and therefore remains toxic. Thus toxic content is only partially removed.
Content Similarity (1): Aside from deleting the profanity, the neutral sentence conveys exactly the same factual information (inability to verify because the Myspace account was deleted, plus the speaker's negative feeling toward the addressee). No core information is lost, so full meaning is preserved.
Fluency (0.5): The sentence is understandable, but it is a run-on with missing punctuation between the two independent clauses, which constitutes a grammatical issue. Therefore it is only moderately fluent.
Joint score: Average of the three sub-scores = (0.5 + 1 + 0.5)/3 ≈ 0.67."
He deserves every beating and rape he will be subjected to.,He deserves every beating and he will be subjected to.,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"STA: The neutral text removes the explicit mention of ""rape,"" reducing some toxicity, but still promotes violence by asserting that the person ""deserves every beating,"" so toxic language is only partially removed. CS: The neutral sentence keeps the idea that the subject ""deserves every beating"" and will experience it, but omits the element of rape, losing part of the original meaning; thus, only partial preservation. FS: The sentence is understandable, but it is grammatically faulty (missing a relative pronoun: ""that he will be subjected to""), making it less than fully fluent."
