any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,any of us who did half this would be locked the up already .,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA): The toxic word 'shit' was removed, which is a positive step toward neutralization. However, the phrase 'locked the fuck up' still contains the profanity 'fuck', which contributes to a toxic tone. Since some toxic language remains, the score is 0.5. For Content Similarity (CS): The neutral text preserves the core meaning of the original sentence—namely, that people doing half of 'this' would already be imprisoned. The removal of 'shit' does not significantly alter the intended message, so the score is 1. For Fluency (FS): The neutral text has a grammatical error: 'locked the up already' is ungrammatical due to the omission of 'fuck' without proper restructuring (should be 'locked up already'). This disrupts readability, though the sentence is still mostly understandable. Thus, the score is 0.5."
are they liars or just clueless ?,are they liars or just clueless ?,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text: 'are they liars or just clueless ?'. The use of 'liars' and 'clueless' carries a negative, accusatory tone, which constitutes toxic content as it involves personal attacks or derogatory implications. Therefore, no detoxification has occurred, resulting in an STA score of 0. However, since the text is unchanged, the core meaning is fully preserved, earning a CS score of 1. The sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and readable, so the FS score is 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .","as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of .",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic phrase 'a piece of shit' has been successfully replaced with 'a piece of', effectively removing the offensive language and rendering the text neutral. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general sentiment of disapproval is implied, the core expression is truncated and the intended derogatory meaning is significantly weakened or lost—'a piece of' is incomplete and fails to convey the original intensity or full meaning. Fluency (FS) is also scored 0.5 because the neutral text ends with an incomplete phrase ('a piece of'), which results in a grammatically incorrect and awkward sentence structure, though the overall sentence remains partially understandable in context."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","calm the down , cnn .",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the toxic phrase 'fuck' has been removed, resulting in 'calm the down, cnn.', which eliminates the profanity and renders the language neutral. Therefore, STA is scored 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS), the core intent of urging CNN to calm down is preserved, but the removal of 'fuck' alters the emotional intensity and emphasis of the original utterance, leading to partial meaning loss. Hence, CS is scored 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the resulting sentence 'calm the down' is grammatically incorrect and awkward due to the missing adverb or intensifier (e.g., 'down' not properly modified), making the sentence sound unnatural. However, the sentence is still minimally understandable. Thus, FS is scored 0.5."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,china and russia will use a big stick to trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 0 because the neutral text fails to remove toxic content. The original toxic text uses the phrase 'smack Trump around', which is a violent and aggressive metaphor, and the rewritten version simply removes 'smack' but retains 'use a big stick to trump around', which still implies a threatening or coercive action. This is not a truly neutral expression and preserves the hostile tone, thus no effective detoxification has occurred. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 1 because the core meaning — that China and Russia will respond strongly to provocative actions by ships — is preserved, despite the awkward phrasing. Fluency (FS) is scored 1 because the neutral text is grammatically correct and readable, even though 'use a big stick to trump around' is semantically odd, it does not constitute a grammatical error or render the sentence incomprehensible."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,cretins like this rarely care about facts .,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text, so the toxic content has not been removed at all. The term 'cretins' is derogatory and constitutes toxic language, yet it remains unchanged, resulting in an STA score of 0. However, since the text is preserved exactly, the core meaning is fully maintained, earning a CS score of 1. The sentence is grammatically correct and easily understandable, so the FS score is 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,do people actually believe this ? ? ?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the offensive word 'shit', which is successfully removed in the neutral text by replacing it with a more neutral expression while preserving the sentence structure and intent. The resulting sentence 'do people actually believe this ? ? ?' is completely free of toxic language, achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning—expressing skepticism about whether people believe something—remains intact, with no significant information loss, so content similarity is fully preserved (CS = 1). The neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and retains the original punctuation and emphasis (multiple question marks), indicating high fluency (FS = 1). All three dimensions are optimally satisfied, resulting in a joint score of 1."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text, which contains a direct threat: 'i will come to your house, and i will cut you.' This language is clearly toxic and aggressive, so no detoxification has occurred, resulting in an STA score of 0. However, because the text is unchanged, all original meaning is preserved, warranting a CS score of 1. The sentence is grammatically correct and easily understandable, so the FS score is 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
even bush knows he fucked up .,even bush knows he up .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the explicit toxic language ('fucked up') and replaces it with a vague but non-toxic expression ('up'), resulting in a completely neutral tone. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the neutral text retains the subject ('Bush') and the implication that he acknowledges a mistake, the phrase 'he up' is ambiguous and fails to clearly convey the original meaning of having made an error, leading to partial loss of core information. Fluency (FS) is scored 0.5 because the sentence 'even bush knows he up' is grammatically incomplete and awkward—'he up' is not a standard English construction and disrupts readability, though the overall meaning is still somewhat understandable in context."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,popeyes for doing this in the first place .,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 because the toxic expletive 'fuck' has been completely removed, resulting in a neutral expression with no remaining offensive language. Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the core subject (Popeyes and their action) is preserved, the removal of the expletive weakens the emotional intensity and dismissiveness of the original sentiment, leading to partial loss of pragmatic meaning. Fluency is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and readable, despite being slightly abrupt. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,getting my kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the toxic phrase 'getting my ass kicked' has been modified to 'getting my kicked', which removes the vulgar expression 'ass', resulting in a fully neutral tone. Therefore, STA is scored 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS), the core idea of learning from a harsh experience with GRE practice tests is preserved, but the phrase 'getting my kicked' is incomplete and distorts the original idiomatic expression 'getting my ass kicked', leading to partial loss of meaning. Hence, CS is scored 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text contains a grammatical error — 'getting my kicked' is syntactically incorrect and non-idiomatic — which disrupts readability, though the rest of the sentence is understandable. Thus, FS is scored 0.5."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,getting stronger every month yeah i wish .,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the profane expression 'i fucking wish', where 'fucking' is used as an intensifier in a sarcastic or frustrated tone. The neutral text replaces 'i fucking wish' with 'i wish', which removes the profanity while preserving the core sentiment of doubt or skepticism about getting stronger every month. Thus, the style transfer is fully successful (STA = 1). The meaning remains intact—both versions express a sarcastic or doubtful reaction to the claim of improvement—so content similarity is fully preserved (CS = 1). The neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and free of any fluency issues, so fluency is perfect (FS = 1). The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
have you ever been to r trees and seen all the shit people say weed can do ? .,have you ever been to r trees and seen all the people say can do ? .,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 because the toxic word 'shit' has been successfully removed and the resulting sentence is completely neutral in tone. Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the general context of questioning about claims seen on 'r trees' is preserved, the removal of 'shit' and the reordering of 'people say can do' leads to a loss of emphasis and clarity about the nature of the exaggerated or dubious claims regarding weed, resulting in partial meaning loss. Fluency is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct and readable, despite the slightly awkward phrasing. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .","holy , a cop got fired ? .",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 because the toxic expression 'holy shit' has been successfully replaced with the neutral exclamation 'holy', completely removing the profanity while maintaining a similar emotional tone. Content Similarity is 1.0 because the core meaning — surprise about a police officer being fired — is fully preserved; the change in exclamation does not alter the essential information. Fluency is 1.0 as the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and fully readable. The revised sentence retains the original structure and punctuation, ensuring clarity and coherence."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,how the do you manage that ? .,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the toxic word 'fuck' has been removed and replaced with a gap ('how the do you manage that ?'), resulting in a completely neutral expression with no offensive language, so a score of 1 is assigned. For Content Similarity (CS), the core intent of questioning how someone manages something is preserved, but the removal of 'fuck' without any compensatory phrasing makes the sentence feel incomplete or awkward, leading to a partial loss of emphasis and natural flow, hence a score of 0.5. For Fluency (FS), despite the missing word, the sentence structure is grammatically correct and readable, and the punctuation is properly used, so it remains fluent enough to understand, warranting a score of 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,how the do you think people afford houses and cars ?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1 because the neutral text successfully removes the profanity 'fuck', resulting in a completely neutral expression. Content Similarity is scored 1 because the core meaning of the original question about affordability of houses and cars is fully preserved, and the removal of 'fuck' does not alter the essential inquiry. Fluency is scored 0.5 because although the sentence is mostly understandable, the removal of 'fuck' without adjusting the surrounding syntax results in an awkward construction: 'how the do you think' is grammatically incorrect and disrupts natural flow, indicating a minor but noticeable language issue."
i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost my pants .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic expression 'almost shit my pants' has been successfully replaced with the neutral 'almost my pants', removing the vulgar language and resulting in completely neutral tone. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general idea of a strong reaction to a misreading is preserved, the core expressive meaning of 'almost shit my pants'—indicating extreme surprise or fear—is significantly weakened or lost in the neutral version, which becomes grammatically incomplete and thus fails to convey the intensity of the original reaction. Fluency (FS) is scored 0.5 because the neutral sentence 'i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost my pants' is missing a verb (e.g., 'wet' or 'soiled') after 'almost', resulting in a grammatical error that disrupts readability, though the overall structure remains understandable in context."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,i did not vandalize anything you .,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic term 'dick' has been completely removed, resulting in a neutral and non-offensive expression. The neutral text no longer contains any toxic language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core assertion 'I did not vandalize anything' is preserved, the removal of 'you dick' eliminates a significant part of the original intent, which includes addressing or insulting a specific person. This alters the pragmatic meaning and emotional context, leading to partial information loss. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and readable, despite the abrupt ending; the sentence structure is valid and understandable. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1)/3 = 0.83."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,i dont give a flying about sides ! .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the toxic phrase 'a flying fuck' has been altered to 'a flying', which removes the explicit profanity. The resulting expression is no longer overtly toxic, and the language is significantly neutralized, warranting a score of 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS), the core intent of indifference is preserved, but the phrase 'a flying' is incomplete and distorts the original idiomatic expression 'don't give a flying fuck', leading to some loss of meaning and nuance. Thus, only partial meaning is preserved, justifying a score of 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text 'i dont give a flying about sides ! .' is grammatically incorrect and awkward due to the truncated phrase 'a flying', which is not a valid standalone expression in English. The sentence is understandable in intent but contains clear expression issues, so a score of 0.5 is appropriate."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,i have toilet paper to wipe my and no shortage of food .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the explicit expression 'my ass', replacing it with a more neutral but incomplete phrase 'my', thus eliminating the potentially vulgar content. The resulting language is now more neutral, though awkward. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general idea of having toilet paper and sufficient food is preserved, the core expression 'wipe my ass'—a key part of the original meaning—is partially lost or rendered incomplete, leading to a noticeable loss of semantic content. Fluency (FS) is scored 0.5 because the neutral text 'i have toilet paper to wipe my and no shortage of food' contains a grammatical error ('wipe my' instead of 'wipe my ass' or a proper replacement like 'wipe myself'), making it awkward and incomplete, though the overall sentence structure remains understandable in context. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.6667."
i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but fucking seriously .,i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but seriously .,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the phrase 'fucking seriously,' which includes a profane intensifier. In the neutral text, this is replaced with 'seriously,' effectively removing the offensive language while maintaining the expressive intent. Thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0 as the output is fully neutral. The core meaning—that the speaker acknowledges the Pope's coolness but expresses a strong, possibly ironic or critical, emphasis—is preserved without distortion, so Content Similarity is 1.0. The neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and free of errors, so Fluency is 1.0. All dimensions receive the highest score, resulting in a joint score of 1.0."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","i sell quite a bit of on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic word 'shit' has been removed and replaced with nothing (effectively omitted), resulting in a completely neutral expression with no offensive or harmful language remaining. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general context of selling items and using PayPal to pay bills is preserved, the core detail of what is being sold ('shit' colloquially meaning drugs or low-quality goods) is lost, leading to partial information loss. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct and readable, despite the omission creating a slightly awkward phrase 'sell quite a bit of on there'—which, while unnatural, does not impede understanding and contains no actual grammatical errors. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1)/3 = 0.83."
"if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the shit out of him .","if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the out of him .",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic phrase 'the shit out of him' has been removed and replaced with a neutral but incomplete phrase 'the out of him', eliminating the offensive language. Thus, the resulting text is free of explicit toxicity. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core idea of severe prosecution by the feds is preserved, the removal of 'the shit' without proper rephrasing results in a grammatically broken expression that distorts the original intensity and meaning of the threat, leading to partial information loss. Fluency (FS) is scored 0.5 because the neutral text is understandable in context but contains a clear grammatical error ('persecute the out of him') due to incomplete rewriting, making the sentence awkward and unidiomatic. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.6667."
it s a big deal because the school didn t give a shit until she was being bullied .,it s a big deal because the school didn t give a until she was being bullied .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic expression 'give a shit' has been replaced with 'give a', which removes the profane language and results in a completely neutral tone. Although the replacement is incomplete, the offensive content is effectively eliminated. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general context about the school's lack of attention until bullying occurred is preserved, the core expression 'didn't give a shit' carries strong emotional emphasis that is lost in the neutral version, leading to partial meaning loss. Fluency (FS) is scored 0.5 because the neutral text 'didn't give a' is grammatically incomplete and awkward, though the overall sentence remains understandable in context. The phrase feels truncated and unnatural, but not entirely incomprehensible."

Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general context and structure are preserved, removing 'shit' alters the emotional intensity and emphasis of the original statement, leading to partial loss of the speaker's intended tone and meaning. Fluency (FS) is scored 0.5 because the neutral text contains a grammatical error ('judging by the i ve seen')—the word 'the' before 'i ve seen' creates an ungrammatical and awkward construction, though the sentence remains broadly understandable. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.6667."
"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up","last warning you , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so like you can wikipedia up",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes all explicit toxic language such as 'fucking tosser' and 'cunts', resulting in a completely neutral tone. The offensive terms are omitted or replaced, and no toxic expressions remain. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general intent of issuing a warning and mentioning the time to resolve a page is preserved, key parts of the original meaning—specifically the criticism of the user's negative impact on Wikipedia—are weakened or lost due to the removal of strong evaluative language without adequate rephrasing to maintain the original emphasis. The phrase 'can wikipedia up' is vague and nonsensical compared to the original 'can fuck wikipedia up', leading to information loss. Fluency (FS) is scored 0.5 because the neutral text is mostly understandable but contains awkward and ungrammatical expressions, such as 'meminutes' (likely a typo for 'minutes') and 'can wikipedia up', which is syntactically incorrect and semantically unclear. These issues reduce readability despite the sentence structure being partially intact."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .","liar , liar pants on fire justin .",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text: 'liar, liar pants on fire justin.' This phrase, while colloquial and childish, carries a derogatory connotation by directly accusing someone of lying in a mocking tone. Therefore, no toxic content has been removed, resulting in an STA score of 0. However, since the text is unchanged, the core meaning is fully preserved, warranting a CS score of 1. The sentence is grammatically correct and easily understandable, despite its informal nature, so the FS score is 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 0 because the neutral text is identical to the toxic text and retains the offensive expression 'dirt bag', which is a derogatory term. Therefore, no toxic content has been removed. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 1 because the output preserves the exact wording and meaning of the original sentence, with no information loss. Fluency (FS) is scored 1 as the sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and fully readable. However, despite high fluency and content preservation, the failure to detoxify the language results in a low joint score."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","no way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic expression 'fucking' has been successfully removed, resulting in a completely neutral sentence with no offensive language. Content Similarity (CS) is 1.0 because the core meaning of the original text — disbelief that number bricks fit in a car and calling it 'bs' — is fully preserved; the removal of 'fucking' does not alter the essential message. Fluency (FS) is 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and fully readable. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1.0."
noones asking you to invade shit .,noones asking you to invade .,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic word 'shit', resulting in a completely neutral expression. The word 'invade' alone is not inherently toxic, so the rewritten sentence avoids offensive language effectively. Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the core idea of 'not being asked to invade' is preserved, the original sentence uses 'invade shit' as a colloquial or emphatic expression, likely meaning 'invade anything' or expressing dismissal. Removing 'shit' without replacement slightly alters the intended emphasis or idiomatic tone, leading to partial meaning loss. Fluency is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence 'noones asking you to invade .' is grammatically correct and readable, despite the oddity of 'invade' without an object—this is a minor semantic issue but does not affect grammatical fluency. The period placement is acceptable in informal writing. Overall, the output is fluent."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,not around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 because the toxic word 'fucking' has been successfully removed, and the resulting sentence uses neutral language with no remaining offensive or aggressive expressions. Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the general intent of disengagement from foreign matters is preserved, the removal of 'fucking' slightly weakens the emphasis or intensity conveyed in the original, which may be part of the speaker's core sentiment. Thus, there is partial but not complete preservation of meaning. Fluency is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and readable, with no structural or syntactic issues. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."

The resulting text uses a truncated and incomplete form but avoids explicit toxicity, so STA is scored 1.0 as the language is now neutral. For Content Similarity (CS), the core idea—that missing footage makes the unaccounted time appear suspicious—is preserved, but the truncation 'shady as .' distorts the original emphatic expression, leading to partial loss of meaning and tone; thus, CS is 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text ends abruptly with 'as .' which is grammatically incorrect and awkward, making the sentence feel incomplete. Despite being understandable in context, this flaw reduces readability, warranting a 0.5. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.6667."

Content Similarity is 1 because the core meaning—that a number will solve many problems if needed—is fully preserved; only the intensifier 'fucking' is removed, which does not alter the essential message. Fluency is scored 0.5 because the neutral text contains a spelling error: 'alot' should be 'a lot'. This is a minor grammatical issue that does not impede understanding but affects language quality. Thus, the joint score is the average: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random shit like this .,org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random like this .,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the toxic word 'shit' has been successfully removed and replaced with a neutral placeholder 'like this', resulting in completely neutral language; thus, STA is scored 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS), the core idea that Wikipedia has articles on random topics is preserved, but the removal of 'shit' without a suitable replacement (e.g., 'topics' or 'subjects') creates a syntactic gap and slightly alters the intended emphasis on triviality, leading to partial meaning preservation; hence, CS is scored 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct and readable despite the awkwardness from the missing noun after 'random', and it maintains natural sentence structure overall; therefore, FS is scored 1.0. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1)/3 = 0.83."
"ouch man , them swedes were dicks to norway =\","ouch man , them swedes were to norway =\",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic term 'dicks' has been completely removed and the resulting sentence uses neutral language with no remaining offensive expressions. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general sentiment of negative treatment by Swedes toward Norway is implied, the specific meaning conveyed by 'dicks'—indicating rudeness or hostility—is lost, leading to a partial loss of core information. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct and readable, despite being slightly awkward due to the omission; it maintains syntactic integrity and clarity.

people are idiots for wasting emergency call time on crap like this .,people are for wasting emergency call time on like this .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'idiots', which is a derogatory term, and replaces it with a structurally neutral construction. The resulting sentence no longer contains explicitly offensive language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core idea—that people are misusing emergency call time—is preserved, the removal of 'idiots' and the awkward phrasing ('people are for wasting...') result in a loss of emphasis and clarity about the speaker's criticism, weakening the original sentiment and intent. Fluency (FS) is also scored 0.5 because the neutral text contains a grammatical error: 'people are for wasting...' is ungrammatical and awkward in English; the correct construction would be something like 'people are wasting...'. This makes the sentence less fluent and slightly harder to interpret, though the general meaning is still understandable."

Thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 as the output is fully neutral. The core message — that the same situation is occurring in the PNW — remains intact without any meaningful loss, so Content Similarity is also 1.0. The neutral text is grammatically correct, concise, and natural-sounding, with no fluency issues, warranting a Fluency score of 1.0.

Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core expression 'I'd love a number pm sunset' is preserved, the removal of 'shit' at the beginning eliminates an emotional or emphatic element present in the original, leading to partial loss of pragmatic meaning or speaker intent, even if the literal content remains somewhat intact.

The original dehumanizing and violent implication is partially masked but not fully neutralized. Content Similarity (CS) is 0.5 because the core event — a man robbing a store and going to prison — is preserved, but the specific consequence (sexual violence) is obscured in the neutral version, leading to significant information loss. The phrase 'get in the' is incomplete and ambiguous, failing to convey the original intent clearly. Fluency (FS) is 0.5 because the neutral text is mostly understandable but ends with the grammatically incomplete and awkward phrase 'get in the', which disrupts readability and suggests a truncation or error.

that almost never happens excepts rarely in shit hole countries .,that almost never happens excepts rarely in hole countries .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the toxic term 'shit hole countries' has been modified to 'hole countries', removing the profane word 'shit'. The resulting expression is significantly less offensive and can be considered neutral, thus earning a score of 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS), the core idea that something rarely happens in certain countries is preserved, but the modification weakens the original emphasis and connotation. The phrase 'hole countries' without 'shit' loses the strong negative judgment present in the original, leading to partial meaning preservation, hence a score of 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text contains the grammatical error 'excepts rarely'—'excepts' should be 'except'—and the phrase 'hole countries' is awkward and semantically unclear without the modifying word. This makes the sentence somewhat awkward and less natural, though still understandable, warranting a 0.5. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.6667."

Fluency is scored 0.5 because the neutral text contains a clear grammatical error ('their is cheap' should be 'their stuff is cheap' or 'they are cheap'), which affects readability and naturalness, though the sentence remains understandable.

Therefore, STA is scored 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS): The core idea of criticizing how people are being treated is partially preserved, but the removal of 'like morons' significantly weakens the original sentiment and intent, leading to a loss of key expressive content. Thus, CS is scored 0.5. For Fluency (FS): The neutral text 'they need stop tratening people like .' contains the misspelled word 'tratening' (likely meant to be 'treating') and ends with an incomplete structure ('like .'), resulting in grammatical and syntactic issues.

For Content Similarity (CS), the original toxic text expresses strong disapproval or insult toward the person, but the replacement 'hole' significantly weakens and distorts the intended meaning—'arse hole' is a clear pejorative, while 'hole' alone lacks the same semantic force and context, leading to partial meaning preservation; hence, CS is scored 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct and syntactically sound, despite being semantically odd; it follows standard English structure and is fully readable, so FS is scored 1.

The omission of the verb makes it unclear what action is expected, resulting in partial information loss. Fluency (FS) is scored 0.5 because the neutral text contains a grammatical error: 'is someone going to me now?' is syntactically incorrect and awkward, as 'going to' requires a verb or complement (e.g., 'hurt', 'punish'), but the sentence lacks one. Despite this, the overall structure is understandable in context."
steak Diane Please stop fucking up my edits on steak diane. Thank you.,steak Diane Please stop up my edits on steak diane. Thank you.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic word 'fucking' has been successfully removed and the resulting text uses neutral language without any offensive or profane expressions. The phrase 'stop up my edits' is grammatically unusual but not toxic. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general intent of requesting to stop interfering with edits is preserved, the removal of 'fucking' alters the emotional intensity and emphasis of the original message, leading to partial loss of pragmatic meaning. The core informational content is mostly retained, but the strength of the objection is diminished. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because although 'stop up my edits' is an uncommon construction, it is still grammatically acceptable and understandable in context, with no clear syntactic errors or readability issues. The sentence flows naturally and maintains proper punctuation and structure."
You amins are such bastards.,You amins are such bastards.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text: 'You amins are such bastards.' The term 'bastards' is a derogatory insult, which constitutes toxic content, and there is no attempt to rephrase or neutralize this language. Therefore, Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 0 because no toxic content has been removed. Content Similarity is scored 1 because the meaning is fully preserved—there is no change in content. Fluency is scored 1 as the sentence is grammatically correct and fully understandable. The joint score is the average of the three: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
"Quit Defacing my user page, you ugly cunt.-","Quit Defacing my user page, you cunt.-",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text changes 'ugly cunt' to 'cunt', which partially reduces the toxicity by removing the explicitly offensive adjective 'ugly', but retains the highly toxic insult 'cunt'. Since the resulting text still contains a severe profanity and personal attack, the detoxification is incomplete, warranting a score of 0.5. For Content Similarity (CS), the core meaning — a demand to stop defacing the user page accompanied by a strong personal insult — is fully preserved; only a modifier is removed, so the meaning remains largely unchanged, justifying a score of 1. For Fluency (FS), the sentence is grammatically correct, syntactically sound, and easily understandable, with no issues in expression, so it receives a score of 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (0.5 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."

Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general structure and intent of mentioning something 'sadder' is preserved, the removal of the offensive term alters the emotional intensity and referential specificity of the original, leading to partial loss of meaning—particularly in what or whom is being referred to. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, syntactically well-formed, and readable, despite the slight awkwardness due to the missing noun after 'sadder'. The sentence remains understandable and free of grammatical errors."
Randi was born a DICK.,Randi was born a DICK.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 0 because the neutral text is identical to the toxic text: 'Randi was born a DICK.' The word 'DICK' is a toxic, derogatory expression, and no effort has been made to replace or rephrase it into a neutral equivalent. Therefore, the toxic content remains fully present. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 1 because the output preserves the exact wording and structure of the input, so the core meaning is completely retained without any alteration or loss. Fluency (FS) is scored 1 because the sentence is grammatically correct, syntactically sound, and easily understandable, despite its offensive content. The joint score is the average of the three: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."

No detoxification has occurred, so the style transfer has failed completely. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 1 because the output is identical to the input, so all original meaning and intent are fully preserved. Fluency (FS) is scored 1 because the sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural in expression. The joint score is the average of the three: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
"MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize, so fuck you.","MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize, so you.",0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text replaces the explicit profanity 'fuck you' with 'so you', which reduces the toxicity but does not fully neutralize the hostile and confrontational tone. The phrase 'so you' still carries an abrupt and potentially aggressive implication in context, so the detoxification is only partial, warranting a 0.5. For Content Similarity (CS), the core message — asserting control over one's user page, denying vandalism, and rejecting criticism — is fully preserved without significant alteration or information loss, justifying a score of 1. For Fluency (FS), the sentence structure is mostly understandable, but 'WAHT' is a clear spelling error (should be 'WHAT'), and the abrupt ending 'so you' feels incomplete or unnatural, disrupting readability. These issues prevent a full fluency score, resulting in 0.5."
I am Nancy and I like to fuck up people's fun.,I am Nancy and I like to up people's fun.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'fuck up people's fun' by replacing it with 'up people's fun', eliminating explicit language and rendering the sentence neutral; thus, STA is scored 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS), the core intent of the original sentence—deliberately spoiling others' enjoyment—is significantly altered by the rewrite, as 'up people's fun' ambiguously suggests enhancing fun rather than ruining it, leading to a partial preservation of meaning and a score of 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral sentence is grammatically correct and readable, despite the unusual phrase 'up people's fun', which is syntactically acceptable; hence, FS is scored 1.0. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."

Therefore, no detoxification has occurred, resulting in an STA score of 0. Despite the lack of style transfer, the content similarity is perfect (CS = 1) because the meaning is fully preserved. The fluency is excellent (FS = 1) as the sentence is grammatically correct and easily understandable. However, the failure to remove toxic content invalidates the detoxification objective, leading to a low joint score."
Thanks for being an ass when I tried to help.,Thanks for being an when I tried to help.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text successfully removes the offensive term 'ass', replacing it with a blank, resulting in a completely neutral expression. Therefore, STA is scored 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS), the core intent of expressing disappointment or frustration when help was not received as expected is partially preserved, but the omission of the key noun 'ass' creates a significant gap in meaning and context, leading to information loss. Hence, CS is scored 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the sentence 'Thanks for being an when I tried to help.' is grammatically incorrect due to the incomplete phrase 'being an' without a following noun, making it awkward and unnatural, though still minimally understandable. Thus, FS is scored 0.5."
"You're a fucking moron, go read the notability guidelines.","You're a moron, go read the notability guidelines.",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text replaces the profanity 'fucking' with a milder term but retains the insult 'moron', which is still a derogatory expression. Therefore, toxic content is partially reduced but not fully eliminated, warranting a score of 0.5. For Content Similarity (CS), the core message — criticizing someone's understanding and directing them to read the notability guidelines — is fully preserved; only a modifier is removed, so the meaning remains intact, justifying a score of 1. For Fluency (FS), the sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, so it receives a score of 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (0.5 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
Some bubble tea for you! thanks ass hole,Some bubble tea for you! thanks hole,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the original toxic phrase 'ass hole' is replaced with 'hole', which removes the offensive insult and results in a completely neutral expression. Although 'hole' may still carry a faint echo of the original insult, in isolation and without 'ass', it is not inherently toxic, so the detoxification is considered successful (score: 1.0). For Content Similarity (CS), the core intent of expressing gratitude while delivering bubble tea is preserved, but replacing 'ass hole' with 'hole' alters the tone and emotional nuance significantly. The original likely intended sarcasm or hostility, which is partially lost, leading to a partial preservation of meaning (score: 0.5). For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct and readable, with no syntactic or structural issues. The phrase 'thanks hole' is unusual but not ungrammatical, and the sentence remains understandable (score: 1.0). The joint score is the average: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
And your dumb people fell for his shenanigans.,And your people fell for his shenanigans.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the derogatory term 'dumb people,' which is successfully removed in the neutral text by simply stating 'your people.' This change eliminates the offensive language while maintaining a completely neutral tone, warranting a Style Transfer Accuracy score of 1.0. The core meaning—that 'your people' were deceived by someone's tricks ('shenanigans')—is fully preserved; only the insulting modifier 'dumb' is removed, which does not alter the essential message, so Content Similarity is also 1.0. The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no fluency issues, resulting in a Fluency score of 1.0. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
These people are INSANE.,These people are INSANE.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text: 'These people are INSANE.' The word 'INSANE' is an exaggerated and potentially offensive expression that conveys a strong negative judgment, which qualifies as toxic content. Since no modification was made to remove or mitigate this language, the Style Transfer Accuracy is 0 because the output remains toxic. However, Content Similarity is 1 because the original meaning is fully preserved without any alteration or information loss. Fluency is 1 because the sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural in expression. The joint score is the average of the three: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
Did you know that you are an ugly piece of shit?,Did you know that you are an piece of shit?,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text changes 'ugly piece of shit' to 'an piece of shit', which removes the adjective 'ugly' but retains the highly offensive insult 'piece of shit'. Since the core toxic expression remains, the detoxification is only partially successful, warranting a 0.5. For Content Similarity (CS), the revised sentence retains the core meaning and target of the original insult, preserving the intent to demean the person, so it scores 1. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text contains a grammatical error: 'an piece of shit' should be 'a piece of shit' due to incorrect article usage. This minor but noticeable error reduces fluency, justifying a 0.5. The joint score is the average of the three: (0.5 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.6667."

The word 'moron' is a derogatory term and constitutes toxic language, so no detoxification has occurred, resulting in an STA score of 0. The content similarity is fully preserved (CS = 1) because the sentence is unchanged and the core meaning remains intact. The sentence is grammatically correct and clearly expressed, so fluency is perfect (FS = 1). However, since the toxic content was not rewritten, the style transfer accuracy is the weakest dimension."
"Yeah, you can fuck off incel.","Yeah, you can off incel.",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the toxic word 'fuck' has been removed and replaced with 'off', resulting in a completely neutral expression without any offensive language, so a score of 1 is assigned. For Content Similarity (CS), the core intent of dismissal or rejection is partially preserved, but the removal of the intensifier 'fuck' significantly weakens the emotional force and pragmatic meaning of the original utterance, leading to partial meaning loss; thus, a score of 0.5 is given. For Fluency (FS), the phrase 'you can off incel' is grammatically incorrect and unnatural—'can off' is not a valid construction in English—making the sentence awkward and non-idiomatic, though the general meaning is still somewhat understandable; therefore, a score of 0.5 is appropriate."
"Stop defending pedophiles, faggot.","Stop defending pedophiles, faggot.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text, meaning no detoxification has occurred. The original text contains highly offensive language ('faggot') and an accusation related to defending pedophiles, both of which constitute toxic content. Since the toxic language is preserved entirely, Style Transfer Accuracy is 0. Content Similarity is 1 because the output is exactly the same as the input, so all original meaning is preserved. Fluency is 1 because the sentence is grammatically correct and fully understandable. However, the lack of any rewriting means the detoxification failed to neutralize the toxic style."

"DUDE CALM THE FUCK DOWN!!!
",DUDE CALM THE DOWN!!! ,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text changes 'FUCK' to nothing, resulting in 'CALM THE DOWN!!!', which is an incomplete removal. While the explicit profanity is removed, the aggressive tone and imperative shouting ('DUDE CALM THE DOWN!!!') remain, and the resulting phrase is awkward and retains a confrontational style. Thus, toxic content is partially removed, warranting a 0.5. For Content Similarity (CS), the core intent — telling someone to calm down — is preserved despite the awkward wording. The key message is still present, so the score is 1. For Fluency (FS), the phrase 'CALM THE DOWN' is grammatically incorrect and unnatural (should be 'calm down'), making the sentence jarring and awkward, though still understandable. This results in a 0.5. The joint score is the average of the three: (0.5 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.6667."
"Some jackass vandalized the article again, can someone fix it?","Some vandalized the article again, can someone fix it?",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 because the toxic term 'jackass' has been successfully removed, resulting in a completely neutral expression. The revised sentence no longer contains any offensive or disrespectful language. Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the core event (vandalism of the article) is preserved, the removal of 'jackass' eliminates a strong evaluative component present in the original text, which conveyed frustration and attributed blame more personally. This softens the speaker's attitude and loses some emotional nuance, leading to partial meaning preservation. Fluency is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any linguistic errors."

The neutral text replaces 'fucking' with a cleaner version 'I hate you,' which reduces the intensity but still retains the expression of hate. Since hate speech is a form of toxic content, and the sentiment remains strongly negative without mitigation (e.g., softening to 'I'm disappointed' or 'I disagree'), the detoxification is only partial. Thus, STA is scored 0.5. For Content Similarity (CS), the core meaning — inability to verify due to a deleted MySpace account and the speaker's strong negative feeling toward the addressee — is fully preserved. Only a single intensifier is removed, so the main message remains intact, warranting a score of 1. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no structural or syntactic issues, so it receives a score of 1.

Therefore, the detoxification is only partial, resulting in a score of 0.5.

For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct and readable, with no structural or syntactic issues, warranting a full score of 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (0.5 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.6667."
