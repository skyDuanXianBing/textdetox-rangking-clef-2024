any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,any of us who did half this would be locked the up already .,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text removes some of the vulgar language (e.g., 'shit' and 'the fuck up'), but it still contains informal language such as 'locked the up already,' which could have been improved to a more neutral tone. The core meaning is fully preserved. The language is fluent and natural."
are they liars or just clueless ?,are they liars or just clueless ?,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The neutral sentence is identical to the toxic one; insulting words ('liars', 'clueless') remain unchanged, so no detoxification occurred (score 0). CS: Because the sentences are identical, the full meaning of the original is preserved (score 1). FS: The sentence is grammatically correct and fully understandable; the extra space before the question mark is a minor punctuation issue but does not impede readability, so fluency is considered intact (score 1). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .","as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of .",0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"STA: The explicit vulgar word “shit” is removed, so the most overt toxicity is gone. However, leaving the phrase ""a piece of"" still clearly signals an insult, so the detoxification is only partial, not fully neutral. CS: The source sentence expresses that the speaker considers the man contemptible (""a piece of shit""). The target loses the specific insult, and because the phrase is incomplete the intended judgement is only implicitly present. Core meaning (speaker holds a very negative opinion of the man) is partially preserved but somewhat obscured, so 0.5. FS: The sentence ends with ""a piece of ."", which is grammatically incomplete and awkward, though the rest of the sentence is readable. Thus it is understandable but not fully fluent, warranting 0.5."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","calm the down , cnn .",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The vulgar language 'fuck' is successfully removed and replaced with a neutral tone, while the core meaning of the sentence is preserved. The sentence structure is fluent and the language is grammatically correct."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,china and russia will use a big stick to trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"STA: The explicitly violent phrase ""smack Trump around"" was removed, reducing the toxicity, but the expression ""use a big stick … around"" still implies violence, so detoxification is only partial. CS: The new sentence keeps the setting (China, Russia, ships, possible retaliation) but loses the specific target (Trump) and meaning by turning ""smack Trump around"" into the unclear phrase ""trump around""; part of the core meaning is lost. FS: The sentence is understandable but the construction ""to trump around"" is ungrammatical and awkward, lowering fluency."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,cretins like this rarely care about facts .,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy: The so-called neutral text is identical to the toxic text and still contains the insult ""cretins,"" so no toxic content was removed (score 0). Content Similarity: Because the texts are identical, the original meaning is fully preserved (score 1). Fluency: The sentence is short, grammatically correct, and easy to read; the extra space before the period is a minor typographical issue that does not impede readability (score 1). Joint score is the average of the three subscores: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,do people actually believe this ? ? ?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic word ""shit"" has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so score is 1.0.
CS: Apart from deleting the vulgar intensifier, the sentence still asks exactly the same question, therefore the core meaning is fully preserved, score 1.0.
FS: The sentence is understandable but the spaced triple question marks ("" ? ? ?"") constitute non-standard punctuation and make the sentence look awkward; this lowers fluency to 0.5 rather than 1.0. Overall joint score is the average: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .",0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy: No toxic elements were removed—the text still contains an explicit threat (“I will cut you”). Therefore STA = 0.
Content Similarity: Because the detoxified sentence is identical to the original, it preserves the entire meaning, so CS = 1.
Fluency: The sentence is understandable, but it has several issues: missing apostrophes in “dont,” inconsistent lowercase “i,” and unnecessary spaces before commas. These errors reduce polish but do not make the sentence unintelligible, so FS = 0.5."
even bush knows he fucked up .,even bush knows he up .,1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The vulgar word “fucked” has been removed and no other toxic language remains, so the toxic style is completely neutralized. CS: The original meaning – that Bush realizes he made a serious mistake – is lost. The phrase “he up” does not convey the idea of making a mistake, so core information is not preserved. FS: The neutral sentence is short and can be guessed at, but it is grammatically incorrect (“he up” is incomplete) and therefore not fully fluent; it is still understandable, so 0.5 is assigned rather than 0."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,popeyes for doing this in the first place .,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic language ('fuck') is completely removed and replaced with a neutral expression. The core meaning is fully preserved, and the language is grammatically correct and fluent."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,getting my kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"The neutral text removes the vulgar term 'ass,' eliminating the toxic expression ('ass kicked'), so style transfer succeeds. However, simply deleting the noun leaves 'getting my kicked,' which breaks the idiomatic meaning and introduces grammatical error. The overall intent—that GRE practice tests led to learning not to repeat the mistake—can still be inferred, but some meaning is lost and the sentence is less clear, hence partial content similarity. Due to the ungrammatical phrase, fluency is only moderate."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,getting stronger every month yeah i wish .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element was the profanity ""fucking,"" which has been removed completely; the sentence is now neutral, so 1.0.
CS: Aside from removing the swear word, the wording and meaning (expressing a doubtful wish about getting stronger every month) are fully retained, so 1.0.
FS: The sentence is understandable but not fully polished: it lacks capitalization, contains an awkward sequence (""getting stronger every month yeah i wish""), and has a stray space before the period. These minor fluency issues warrant a deduction, so 0.5."
have you ever been to r trees and seen all the shit people say weed can do ? .,have you ever been to r trees and seen all the people say can do ? .,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text partially removes toxic language ('shit' to 'people say'), but it does not entirely eliminate all potentially problematic expressions, such as the casual and vague 'all the people say.' The core meaning of the sentence is preserved, as it still discusses the things people claim weed can do, though the tone is a bit softened. The sentence is fluent and grammatically correct."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .","holy , a cop got fired ? .",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The vulgar expression 'holy shit' was successfully removed and replaced with the neutral 'holy', which is a neutral exclamation. The original meaning is fully preserved, and the text is grammatically correct and fluent."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,how the do you manage that ? .,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Successfully removed vulgar language and made the expression neutral while maintaining the original meaning. The sentence structure remains grammatically correct, and the language is fluent and natural."
how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,how the do you think people afford houses and cars ?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element is the expletive ""fuck"", which has been removed; the sentence is now non-toxic, so STA = 1.0. CS: Apart from deleting the swear word, the question about how people can afford houses and cars is completely preserved, so CS = 1.0. FS: The edited sentence reads ""how the do you think..."", which is missing a word after ""the"" and sounds ungrammatical. It is understandable but not fully fluent, so FS = 0.5."
i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost my pants .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The offensive word ""shit"" was removed, so the sentence no longer contains profanity; toxicity is fully neutralised. CS: The core event of mis-reading a title and having a strong reaction is retained, but the phrase ""almost my pants"" omits the verb and therefore only partially conveys the original humorous meaning (loss of the idea of nearly defecating). FS: The sentence is understandable yet ungrammatical; ""almost my pants"" is incomplete and awkward, hurting fluency. Hence scores: STA 1, CS 0.5, FS 0.5."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,i did not vandalize anything you .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The insulting word ""dick"" has been completely removed, so the text is no longer toxic (score 1).
CS: The main assertion, ""I did not vandalize anything,"" is preserved, but the sentence fragment ""you"" no longer clearly functions as an address, making the statement slightly ambiguous and losing a bit of the original pragmatic context (score 0.5).
FS: The resulting sentence ""i did not vandalize anything you ."" is understandable but ungrammatical due to the stray ""you"" and missing punctuation/capitalization, so fluency is impaired though not entirely broken (score 0.5)."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,i dont give a flying about sides ! .,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the vulgar expression 'flying fuck', converting it to a neutral form without altering the meaning of the sentence. The language remains fluent and natural without any grammatical errors."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,i have toilet paper to wipe my and no shortage of food .,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Successfully removed the vulgar expression 'ass' and replaced it with a neutral phrasing, maintaining the original meaning without any loss of content. The language is fluent and grammatically correct, with no errors."
i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but fucking seriously .,i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but seriously .,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The only toxic element in the source sentence is the expletive ""fucking,"" which has been removed entirely, yielding a fully neutral sentence (STA=1). Aside from deleting that intensifier, the rest of the wording and meaning are unchanged, so the core content is fully preserved (CS=1). The resulting sentence is grammatical and easy to read; although the informal style and lowercase ‘i’ mirror the original, they do not impede comprehension, so fluency is high (FS=1)."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","i sell quite a bit of on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic element was the vulgar word ""shit""; it has been completely removed and no new toxic wording was introduced, so STA = 1.0.
CS: The core idea (the speaker sells things there and PayPal helps pay the bills) is mostly kept, but the object of ""sell"" is now missing, slightly obscuring the intended meaning (‘stuff/items’). Hence partial preservation → CS = 0.5.
FS: The sentence is understandable but ungrammatical: ""i sell quite a bit of on there"" lacks an object, producing awkwardness. Therefore, it is only partially fluent → FS = 0.5."
"if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the shit out of him .","if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the out of him .",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The profanity ""shit"" has been removed and no other toxic or aggressive slur remains, so the sentence is neutral (score 1).
CS: The core idea—that if he is found to have acted in cold blood, the federal authorities will persecute him—remains. However, the intensifying nuance of “the shit out of him” is lost and the phrase becomes syntactically defective, so some meaning clarity is lost (score 0.5).
FS: The phrase ""persecute the out of him"" is ungrammatical and awkward, though the sentence is still barely understandable. This lowers fluency but does not make it incomprehensible (score 0.5)."
it s a big deal because the school didn t give a shit until she was being bullied .,it s a big deal because the school didn t give a until she was being bullied .,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"The toxic word 'shit' was partially removed by omitting it, but the phrasing 'didn’t give a' still feels incomplete or somewhat neutralized without a clear replacement. While the meaning is preserved (the school didn’t care until bullying occurred), the neutral version is missing the explicit word 'shit,' which weakens the complete removal of toxicity. The content similarity remains intact. The language is fluent and natural with no grammatical errors."
"judging by the shit i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .","judging by the i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic term 'shit' is successfully removed and replaced with a neutral expression. The original meaning is completely preserved, and the language is fluent and natural without any grammatical errors."
"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up","last warning you , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so like you can wikipedia up",0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"The toxic text contains offensive language ('tosser', 'cunts'), and while some of these terms are removed in the neutral text, 'like you' remains somewhat aggressive, and the phrase 'fuck wikipedia up' is softened, but still carries negative connotations. The core meaning of the message is maintained, but the fluency of the neutral text is compromised by the awkward phrase 'it takes meminutes' and missing parts like 'can fuck'. The text is understandable but slightly ungrammatical."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .","liar , liar pants on fire justin .",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text does not effectively remove toxic content. The phrase 'liar, liar pants on fire' is still in use, maintaining the mocking tone and childish insult. The meaning of the original text is preserved, but the toxicity remains, making it unsuitable as a neutral version. The language is grammatically correct and fluent, but the style is not neutral."
my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The neutral text retains the insult ""dirt bag,"" so no toxic language was removed; score 0.  CS: The neutral text is identical to the original, therefore it fully preserves the meaning; score 1.  FS: The sentence is short, grammatical, and easy to read; score 1."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","no way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic language ('no fucking way') has been fully removed and replaced with a neutral phrase ('no way'). The meaning of the sentence remains entirely intact, and the expression is grammatically correct and fluent."
noones asking you to invade shit .,noones asking you to invade .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence removed the profanity “shit,” leaving a completely neutral wording, so toxic content is fully removed (1.0).
CS: The core meaning—‘No one is asking you to invade’—is fully retained; the removed word was only an intensifier, so content similarity is complete (1.0).
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it contains grammatical problems: ‘noones’ lacks the apostrophe (‘no one’s’) and there is an extra space before the period. These issues hurt fluency though readability remains, so 0.5 is appropriate.
Overall, the joint score is the average of the three dimensions."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,not around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic element is the expletive 'fucking', which has been completely removed, so the sentence is fully neutral (score 1).
CS: The original meaning is partially preserved: it still talks about not engaging in foreign matters we cannot influence. However, omitting the verb 'fucking around' leaves the construction 'not around' and weakens the idea of 'not meddling', so some semantic nuance is lost (score 0.5).
FS: The result is understandable but ungrammatical; 'not around in foreign matters' lacks a clear main verb, creating an awkward, fragment-like sentence. This places it in the partially fluent category (score 0.5)."
nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady as fuck .,nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady as .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the profanity ""fuck"". It has been completely removed, and no new toxic wording was introduced, so Style Transfer Accuracy = 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence still states that the absence of footage will make the events during that period appear shady. The loss of the intensifier ""as fuck"" slightly weakens emphasis but does not alter the core meaning, so Content Similarity is judged to be fully preserved (1).
FS: The sentence ends with the fragment ""shady as ."", which is ungrammatical and sounds incomplete. While the overall message is still understandable, this clear grammatical error lowers readability, so Fluency = 0.5.
Overall, the joint score (average of the three sub-scores) is (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
number will solve alot of fucking problems if it comes down to it .,number will solve alot of problems if it comes down to it .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The profane word ""fucking"" has been removed, leaving no toxic or aggressive language, so style transfer is fully successful. CS: Aside from removing the profanity, all other words and structure remain the same, so the original meaning is completely preserved. FS: The sentence is understandable but contains a spelling error (""alot"" instead of ""a lot"") and is somewhat awkward (missing an article before ""number""), so it is not fully fluent, warranting a 0.5."
org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random shit like this .,org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random like this .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the vulgar word ""shit."" The neutral sentence removes this word completely and does not introduce any new offensive language, so STA = 1.0.
CS: While the core idea—that Wikipedia has articles on very random topics—remains, dropping the noun after ""random"" eliminates the explicit reference to ""stuff/things."" This creates a slight semantic gap and makes the sentence somewhat less clear, so CS = 0.5.
FS: The output is understandable, but it is grammatically awkward: ""for all sorts of random like this"" is not standard English, and the contraction ""there s"" lacks an apostrophe. These issues lower fluency, so FS = 0.5."
"ouch man , them swedes were dicks to norway =\","ouch man , them swedes were to norway =\",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"STA: The only toxic element, the insult ""dicks"", has been completely deleted, leaving no abusive language, so the detoxification itself is successful. CS: The original message stated that the Swedes were behaving badly toward Norway; the neutral sentence drops the descriptive predicate entirely (""them swedes were to norway""), so the core meaning — the negative treatment — is lost. Hence almost no preservation of meaning. FS: The rewritten sentence is ungrammatical and hard to interpret (it lacks a complement after ""were""), making the text barely understandable. Therefore fluency is scored 0."
people are idiots for wasting emergency call time on crap like this .,people are for wasting emergency call time on like this .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The words ""idiots"" and ""crap""—the clearly toxic elements—have been removed, and no new offensive terms were introduced, so toxic content is fully neutralised (1.0). CS: The key idea that people are being criticised for wasting emergency call time is partially present (""people … wasting emergency call time on … like this""), but the evaluative stance is weakened and the sentence is syntactically incomplete, causing partial loss of meaning (0.5). FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but grammatically faulty (""people are for … on like this"" lacks necessary words), yielding awkward, non-standard English; hence only partial fluency (0.5)."
"quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some idiot hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .","quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicit insult ""idiot"" has been completely removed, leaving a neutral description, so toxicity is fully eliminated. 
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the core statement about saints being canonized for opposing a hierarch but drops the evaluative nuance that the hierarch was an “idiot,” thus losing a piece of semantic information; therefore only partial meaning preservation (0.5).
FS: The sentence is understandable, yet it contains awkward spacing before commas, the fragmentary phrase ""like st ."", and archaic wording ""even unto being killed,"" which together lower smoothness. These are minor but noticeable issues, so fluency is rated 0.5."
read your own fucking link .,read your own link .,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element is the profanity ""fucking,"" which has been completely removed, leaving purely neutral language. CS: Aside from removing the profanity, the sentence keeps the exact instruction and meaning, so no information is lost. FS: The rewritten sentence is short, grammatical, and easily understood; minor stylistic details (lower-case initial letter, extra space before the period) do not hinder readability, consistent with earlier full-score examples."
same crap going on in the pnw too .,same going on in the pnw too .,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element, the word ""crap,"" has been removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so style transfer is fully successful.
CS: Apart from the removal of the vulgar word, the message—that the same thing is happening in the Pacific Northwest—remains intact, so core meaning is preserved.
FS: The neutral sentence lacks a verb or placeholder noun (e.g., ""Same thing is going on..."") and feels elliptical. While still understandable, the grammar is imperfect, so fluency is only partial."
"shit , i d love an number pm sunset .",", i d love an number pm sunset .",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic word ""shit"" has been completely removed and no new toxic wording appears, so toxicity is fully neutralised (score 1).
CS: Apart from deleting the expletive, the rest of the sentence is left unchanged, so the intent – expressing a wish to have a number by sunset – is preserved (score 1).
FS: The neutral sentence is still awkward: it begins with a stray comma, lacks capitalisation, uses ""i d"" instead of ""I'd,"" and the phrase ""an number pm sunset"" is grammatically odd. While it can be guessed what the speaker means, these issues hurt readability, so fluency is only partially acceptable (score 0.5)."
some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped in the ass .,some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get in the .,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"STA: The explicit toxic phrase ""raped in the ass"" has been completely removed, leaving no insulting or vulgar content, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0. CS: The neutral sentence omits the key idea that the man will be sexually assaulted; the phrase ends abruptly ('to get in the .'), so the original core meaning is not preserved, yielding a Content Similarity score of 0.0. FS: The rewritten sentence is ungrammatical and incomplete ('to get in the .'), making it difficult to understand, therefore Fluency is 0.0."
"someone says no , and they say fuck off we need vets only for free housing ? .","someone says no , and they say off we need vets only for free housing ? .",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicit toxic word 'fuck' has been removed; the remaining sentence contains no profane or hateful content, so toxicity is fully eliminated.
CS: The main idea (someone responds negatively and insists on housing only for veterans) is retained, but the removal of 'fuck' also deletes the strong dismissive intent conveyed by the phrase 'fuck off'. In addition, the altered fragment 'they say off' is semantically unclear, so part of the original meaning is lost ⇒ 0.5.
FS: The sentence is mostly understandable, but the segment 'they say off we need vets only for free housing ?' is grammatically awkward and missing necessary elements (e.g., ‘say “off”’ or ‘tell them off’). Punctuation spacing is also odd, resulting in mediocre fluency ⇒ 0.5."
still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: No toxic terms ('lying', 'crazy') were removed; the text is identical to the original, so detoxification failed (0). CS: Because the texts are identical, the core meaning is fully preserved (1). FS: The sentence is grammatical and fully readable; the only minor stylistic issue is lowercase initial, which does not hinder fluency (1). Joint score is the average of the three dimensions."
sucked like nothings ever sucked before .,like nothings ever before .,1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The offensive term ""sucked"" has been completely removed, and no other toxic expressions are present, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0. CS: The original sentence expressed strong negativity (that something ""sucked"" extremely). The neutral version omits this evaluative meaning entirely, leaving only the comparative phrase; therefore the core meaning is not preserved, giving a score of 0. Fluency: ""like nothings ever before ."" is a sentence fragment, lacks the verb, and misses the apostrophe in ""nothing's"", but it is still more or less understandable, so Fluency is 0.5."
taking a stand with either party is equally retarded .,taking a stand with either party is equally .,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"STA: The toxic slur ""retarded"" has been completely removed, leaving no offensive language, so style transfer accuracy is full.
CS: The rewritten sentence omits the key evaluative word, so the main idea (that supporting either side is equally foolish/bad) is not conveyed; virtually all core meaning is lost, giving a score of 0.
FS: The resulting sentence ""taking a stand with either party is equally ."" is grammatically incomplete and difficult to understand, so fluency is 0."
that almost never happens excepts rarely in shit hole countries .,that almost never happens excepts rarely in hole countries .,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicit profanity ""shit"" has been removed, which softens the toxicity, but the phrase ""hole countries"" still carries a derogatory implication and is clearly derived from the toxic expression, so the toxic attitude is only partially mitigated. CS: Aside from dropping the profanity, the sentence keeps the same meaning: the event almost never happens except (rarely) in certain countries; thus the core information is preserved. FS: The sentence is understandable but not fully fluent: ""excepts rarely"" is ungrammatical (should be ""except rarely""), and ""hole countries"" is awkward and unidiomatic. Hence, partial fluency problems warrant a 0.5."
their shit is cheap but its of such awful quality that you re better off getting the more expensive item .,their is cheap but its of such awful quality that you re better off getting the more expensive item .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic word ""shit"" has been removed, leaving no aggressive or profane language, so the detoxification is fully successful (1.0). CS: Dropping the noun ""shit"" eliminates the explicit reference to the product; the sentence now starts with the ungrammatical fragment ""their is cheap"". While the overall idea (cheap but awful quality, better to buy the expensive item) can still be inferred, some semantic information and clarity are lost, so partial preservation (0.5). FS: The resulting sentence contains several grammatical problems (""their is cheap"", ""its"" instead of ""it's"", spacing in ""you re""), making it awkward though still comprehensible, hence partially fluent (0.5)."
they need stop tratening people like morons .,they need stop tratening people like .,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the explicit insult ""morons"", so the toxic content is fully eliminated, warranting 1.0. CS: The main idea that ""they need to stop treating people like morons"" is only partially kept; the phrase after ""like"" is truncated, so the comparison that explains HOW they treat people is lost. Therefore only partial meaning is preserved → 0.5. FS: The sentence is comprehensible but ungrammatical—missing 'to' ('need to stop'), retains the misspelling 'tratening', and ends abruptly after 'like', which hurts readability though it can still be deciphered. This places it in the middle tier → 0.5."
they re both fucked up .,they re both up .,1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The offensive word ""fucked"" has been completely removed and no new toxic language appears, so the text is fully neutral (score 1).
CS: The original sentence means that both people are in a bad or problematic state (""fucked up""). The rewritten sentence merely states that they are ""up"" (awake/standing), which drops the core semantic notion of being messed up. Therefore, the original meaning is not preserved (score 0).
FS: The sentence is intelligible, but it contains punctuation and contraction errors (""they re"" instead of ""they're"", extra space before the period). These issues hurt grammaticality though the sentence can still be understood, so partial fluency (score 0.5)."
this guy is a total sellout with no brains for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking .,this guy is a total sellout with no brains for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking .,0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The so-called neutral sentence is identical to the toxic one; insults such as ""total sellout,"" ""no brains,"" and ""lacks the ability of forward thinking"" remain, so no detoxification occurred (score 0). CS: Because the sentences are identical, every bit of original information is preserved (score 1). FS: The sentence is generally understandable but contains a grammatical awkwardness—""the ability of forward thinking"" should be ""the ability for forward thinking"" or similar—so fluency is acceptable but not perfect (score 0.5)."
"this is a joke , are you all fucking retards ? .","this is a joke , are you all ? .",1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The offensive phrase ""fucking retards"" has been completely removed, leaving no toxic wording, so style transfer accuracy is 1.
CS: The core meaning of the second clause is lost. The original asks ""are you all retards?"" (insulting query). The neutral version truncates it to ""are you all?"", which does not convey the same semantic content. Only the first clause ""this is a joke"" remains intact, so preservation of meaning is essentially absent → 0.
FS: The sentence is mostly understandable but has clear grammatical/punctuation problems: unnecessary spaces, an unfinished question (""are you all?""), and an extra period. Hence fluency is reduced but not incomprehensible → 0.5."
this is some twilight zone shit,this is some twilight zone,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element is the profanity ""shit,"" which has been removed entirely, so toxicity is fully eliminated.
CS: Removing the profanity does not change the core meaning (‘this situation feels like the Twilight Zone’), so the semantic content is completely preserved.
FS: The sentence ""this is some twilight zone"" is understandable but sounds awkward and incomplete in standard English (one expects “…some Twilight Zone stuff/situation”). This mild grammatical oddity lowers fluency to 0.5."

what an arse hole you are !,what an hole you are !,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA: The original toxic term is ""arse hole"" (insult). The rewritten sentence still directly insults the addressee by calling them a ""hole"" (clearly intended as the same insult, just truncated), so toxicity is only partially reduced. CS: Aside from dropping the syllable ""arse"", the sentence keeps the same structure and message—an insult toward the listener—so the core meaning is fully preserved. FS: ""what an hole you are !"" is understandable but ungrammatical (wrong article usage and spacing before the exclamation mark), so fluency is impaired but not incomprehensible."
"whats the title of this report , no shit ? .","whats the title of this report , no ? .",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The profanity ""shit"" has been completely removed and no other toxic wording is present, so the style is fully neutral (1.0).
CS: The core request about the title of the report is retained, but the sarcastic nuance conveyed by ""no shit?"" (meaning something like “obviously, right?”) is lost; the replacement ""no?"" is weaker and potentially changes the tone. Therefore only partial meaning preservation (0.5).
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but contains several fluency issues: missing apostrophe in ""what's"", unnecessary spaces before punctuation, a redundant period after the question mark. These make it less than fully fluent, though still readable (0.5)."

CS: The phrase ""comparitively fuck all"" means ""almost nothing,"" while the rewritten phrase ""comparitively all"" conveys the opposite (everything). This flips the core message, so the essential meaning is not preserved, yielding CS = 0.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it still contains the misspelling ""comparitively,"" awkward spacing/punctuation ("","" before a space, and ""? .""), so it is not fully fluent. Therefore FS = 0.5."
yeah they don t give a fuck .,yeah they don t give a .,1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The offensive word “fuck” has been completely removed, leaving no toxic language, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.

FS: The sentence is understandable but clearly ungrammatical: “yeah they don’t give a .” has a dangling article and punctuation problems. Hence Fluency is mediocre, earning 0.5.
