any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,Any of us who did half this stuff would be locked up already.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Profanity ('shit', 'the fuck') is removed or replaced with neutral wording ('stuff') and the intensifier is dropped, so toxicity is eliminated (STA=1.0).

china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,China and Russia will use diplomatic measures to caution Trump about the consequences of reckless actions regarding those ships.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The violent, aggressive wording 'use a big stick to smack Trump around' has been replaced by the neutral phrase 'use diplomatic measures to caution Trump.' No insulting or violent language remains, so toxic content is fully removed.
CS: The core idea that China and Russia will react if Trump’s ships act foolishly is retained. However, the nature of the reaction changes from the threat of force ('big stick to smack') to mere diplomacy, which weakens the original meaning. Therefore, only partial preservation earns 0.5.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, clear and natural: proper capitalization, no punctuation errors, coherent structure. Hence fluency is high (1.0)."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,People like this rarely care about facts.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The insulting term ""cretins"" was replaced with the neutral word ""People,"" so all toxic content is removed, earning a full score.

FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fully fluent, so it receives 1. Overall, the average (joint) score is (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 ≈ 0.83."

CS: The core idea that the speaker warns the other person not to change their edits and indicates a negative consequence is kept, but the nature of the consequence shifts from physical harm to mere annoyance, which alters the strength and intent of the original message. Therefore only partial preservation (0.5).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, coherent, and easy to read; no errors hinder comprehension, so fluency is full (1)."
