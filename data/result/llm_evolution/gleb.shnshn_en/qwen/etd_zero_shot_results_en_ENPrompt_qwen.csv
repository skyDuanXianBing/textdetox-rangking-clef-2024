Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the surface structure is preserved, the core meaning is significantly altered—the original uses a vulgar metaphor likely to express a judgment about Randi's character or identity, which is lost in the neutral version. Simply stating 'born a person' is factually vague and strips away the intended (though toxic) expressive content, leading to partial meaning preservation. Fluency is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding in English."
This is your last warning; stop being an asshole.,This is your last warning; stop being rude.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic term 'asshole' has been successfully replaced with the neutral and less offensive term 'rude', effectively removing the toxicity while maintaining a similar level of admonishment. This ensures the neutral text is free of toxic language, warranting a full score for Style Transfer Accuracy. The core meaning—a final warning for inappropriate behavior—is preserved without distortion or omission, justifying a full score for Content Similarity. The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, so Fluency also receives the highest score. All three dimensions are fully satisfied, resulting in a joint score of 1."

'MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WHAT I WANT I do not vandalize, so I disagree.'",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic expression 'fuck you' has been successfully replaced with the neutral phrase 'I disagree,' resulting in completely non-toxic and neutral language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core idea of asserting one's right to speak on their user page and denying vandalism is preserved, the emotional intensity and confrontational tone of the original message are significantly softened, which may alter the speaker's intended stance or emphasis. The replacement of a strong offensive retort with a mild disagreement leads to partial, though not complete, preservation of meaning. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and readable, with only a minor capitalization inconsistency ('WAHT' corrected to 'WHAT') that does not affect overall fluency."
I am Nancy and I like to fuck up people's fun.,I am Nancy and I like to ruin people's fun.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the phrase 'fuck up people's fun', which is a vulgar expression. The neutral text replaces it with 'ruin people's fun', which conveys the same meaning in a completely non-toxic and neutral manner, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning—that Nancy enjoys spoiling others' enjoyment—is preserved without any loss, so content similarity is fully maintained (CS = 1). The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no fluency issues (FS = 1). Therefore, all three dimensions score perfectly, resulting in a joint score of 1.0."

""Heh, look, not everything is on Google.""",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'you are a dumbass' and the remaining sentence is completely free of offensive language, achieving a neutral tone. Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the core observation about information not being entirely available on Google is preserved, the dismissive and insulting intent toward the addressee is removed, which was part of the original message's communicative purpose. Thus, some meaning is lost. Fluency is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and fully readable without any language issues."
Thanks for being an ass when I tried to help.,"Here is the detoxified text:

""Thanks for being difficult when I tried to help.""",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully replaces the toxic term 'ass' with the non-offensive and contextually appropriate phrase 'difficult', effectively removing the offensive language while maintaining a neutral tone, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning—that the person responded uncooperatively despite an attempt to help—is preserved without distortion or omission, so content similarity is fully maintained (CS = 1). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, showing no fluency issues (FS = 1). All three dimensions are optimally satisfied, resulting in a joint score of 1."

""Go read the notability guidelines.""",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text successfully removes the profanity ('fucking moron') and transforms the utterance into a non-toxic directive, resulting in a score of 1. The original insult is fully eliminated, and the remaining sentence does not contain any offensive language. For Content Similarity (CS), while the core intent of directing someone to read the notability guidelines is preserved, the emphasis on the person's lack of knowledge or competence (the 'moron' critique) is partially lost. This weakens the original meaning, which included both a personal judgment and a directive, leading to a score of 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no syntactic or lexical issues, warranting a score of 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."

Thanks!""",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the offensive term 'ass hole', which is successfully removed in the neutral text and replaced with a polite 'Thanks!'. This results in a completely neutral expression, earning a Style Transfer Accuracy score of 1.0. The core meaning — expressing gratitude while offering bubble tea — is fully preserved; only the offensive language is removed, so Content Similarity is also 1.0. The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, warranting a Fluency score of 1.0. All three dimensions are optimally satisfied, leading to a joint score of 1.0."
And your dumb people fell for his shenanigans.,'And your people fell for his antics.',1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic term 'dumb people' and replaces it with the more neutral 'people', eliminating the derogatory language while maintaining a respectful tone, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning—that 'your people were deceived by his tricks'—is preserved; 'shenanigans' is appropriately replaced with the synonymous 'antics', which conveys the same idea in a neutral way, so content similarity is fully maintained (CS = 1). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, showing no fluency issues (FS = 1). All three dimensions are optimally satisfied, resulting in a joint score of 1."
These people are INSANE.,These people are crazy.,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the toxic text uses 'INSANE' in all caps, which intensifies the negative and potentially toxic judgment. The neutral text replaces it with 'crazy', which is less intense but still conveys a similar derogatory or emotionally charged sentiment. 'Crazy' can still be considered a pejorative term when referring to people, so the toxicity is reduced but not fully eliminated, warranting a score of 0.5. For Content Similarity (CS), the meaning is preserved almost entirely—both sentences express strong disapproval or disbelief toward 'these people', so the core message remains intact, justifying a score of 1. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, so it receives a score of 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (0.5 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
Did you know that you are an ugly piece of shit?,'Did you know that you are a piece?',1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes all toxic content—the offensive terms 'ugly piece of shit' are eliminated, and the resulting sentence uses non-offensive language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the structure and some words are preserved, the core meaning is significantly altered. The original insult is reduced to a vague and semantically incomplete phrase 'a piece', which lacks the intended meaning or emotional weight, resulting in partial information loss. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, syntactically sound, and easily readable, despite its oddity in meaning. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
Be careful who you call a moron.,Be careful who you call.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic term 'moron', which is a derogatory insult, and replaces it with a more neutral expression. The resulting sentence avoids any offensive language and is completely neutral in tone. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core idea of caution in speech is preserved, the specific target of the caution—calling someone a 'moron'—is omitted, leading to a loss of the original emphasis and context. The neutral version is more generic and lacks the original's specific reference, resulting in partial meaning preservation. Fluency (FS) is 1.0 because the neutral sentence 'Be careful who you call.' is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding in English.

"Yeah, you can fuck off incel.","Here's the detoxified text:

""Yeah, you can off.""",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic content, particularly the offensive term 'fuck off' and the derogatory label 'incel', has been completely removed, resulting in a superficially neutral expression. However, Content Similarity (CS) is 0 because the core meaning of the original insult is entirely lost—the neutral text 'Yeah, you can off.' is nonsensical and fails to preserve any meaningful intent or message from the original. Fluency (FS) is also 0 because the sentence 'Yeah, you can off.' is grammatically incorrect and not a valid English construction—'can off' is not a proper verb phrase, making the sentence difficult to understand. As a result, despite successful detoxification, the output fails in meaning preservation and fluency."
"Stop defending pedophiles, faggot.",Stop defending.,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text completely removes the toxic content, including the offensive slurs 'pedophiles' and 'faggot', and the resulting text 'Stop defending.' is entirely free of toxic language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.0 because the neutral text drastically truncates the original message, omitting the core referent of 'pedophiles' and the entire second part of the sentence. The key subject and context are lost, leaving only an incomplete command with ambiguous reference, thus failing to preserve the original meaning. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because 'Stop defending.' is a grammatically correct and syntactically fluent sentence, despite its brevity. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
"No one is vandalizing assholes, so get it straight!!!","No one is vandalizing, so get it straight!",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic term 'assholes', resulting in a completely non-toxic and neutral expression. The phrase 'No one is vandalizing, so get it straight!' contains no offensive language and effectively eliminates the original hostility. Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the core idea of correcting a misconception about vandalism is preserved, the removal of 'assholes' omits the original emphasis on the target of the vandalism accusation, which was a key part of the speaker's intent. This results in partial, but not complete, preservation of meaning. Fluency is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any linguistic errors.

"DUDE CALM THE FUCK DOWN!!!
",DUDE CALM DOWN!!!,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text changes 'CALM THE FUCK DOWN' to 'CALM DOWN', which reduces the intensity of the profanity, but the overall tone remains aggressive due to the use of 'DUDE' in all caps and multiple exclamation marks. Thus, toxic content is partially removed, warranting a score of 0.5. For Content Similarity (CS), the core meaning—an urgent demand for someone to calm down—is fully preserved without adding or omitting key information, so the score is 1. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and readable, despite the capitalization and punctuation, so it receives a score of 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (0.5 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."

Thus, the text is partially detoxified but still contains a direct personal attack. Content Similarity is scored 1 because the neutral text preserves all key information from the original: the inability to verify due to the deleted MySpace account and the expression of strong negative emotion toward the person. The core meaning is intact. Fluency is scored 1 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clearly structured, and fully readable. The joint score is the average of the three: (0.5 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
He deserves every beating and rape he will be subjected to.,He deserves consequences for his actions.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1 because the neutral text completely removes the toxic content—specifically the violent and sexually abusive language ('every beating and rape')—and replaces it with a socially acceptable expression ('consequences for his actions'). The resulting text is fully neutral and free of harmful language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general idea that the person should face negative outcomes for their behavior is preserved, the original text expresses a specific, extreme, and personal form of retribution, which is significantly downplayed in the neutral version. The core sentiment of deserving punishment is retained, but the intensity and specificity are lost, leading to partial meaning preservation. Fluency (FS) is scored 1 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any linguistic errors.
