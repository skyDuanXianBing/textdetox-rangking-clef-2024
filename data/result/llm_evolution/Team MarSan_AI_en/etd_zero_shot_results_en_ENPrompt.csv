any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,any of us who did half this thing would be locked up already,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All profanities (""shit"", ""the fuck"") have been removed or replaced with neutral wording, so the sentence is fully detoxified – score 1.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the full original meaning: if any of us did even half of the unnamed actions, we would already be in jail. Replacing ""shit"" with ""thing"" and deleting the interjection ""the fuck"" do not alter the propositional content – score 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, clear, and easily readable: ""Any of us who did half this thing would be locked up already."" No errors that hinder comprehension – score 1."
are they liars or just clueless ?,Are they liars or just clueless?,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The supposed neutral text is essentially identical to the toxic text (it only capitalizes the first word and removes a spacing error). The pejorative words ""liars"" and ""clueless"" remain, so no detoxification occurred ⇒ 0.
CS: Because the text is unchanged in content, the original meaning is fully preserved ⇒ 1.
FS: The neutral version is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and fluent ⇒ 1."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .","As someone from LA and an oilfield worker, I still say this guy is not good",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic phrase “piece of shit” is fully replaced with the neutral phrase “not good,” leaving no offensive language; hence a perfect score. CS: The sentence still conveys that, as an LA resident and oilfield worker, the speaker thinks negatively of the same person, so the core meaning is preserved despite softer wording; scored 1. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, correctly capitalized, and easy to read, warranting full fluency. All three dimensions therefore receive 1, giving an average joint score of 1.0."

CS: The rewritten sentence still instructs CNN to calm down, preserving the complete intent and core meaning. Therefore CS = 1.
FS: ""calm down, cnn"" is short, grammatically correct, and easily readable. The only minor point is capitalization of ""CNN,"" but this does not hinder understanding, so FS = 1.
All three dimensions score 1, giving a joint score of 1.0."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,China and Russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish,0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The neutral sentence is virtually identical to the toxic one; the violent phrase ""use a big stick to smack trump around"" is unchanged. Therefore no detoxification occurred, so STA = 0.
CS: Because the wording and meaning are fully retained, content preservation is complete, so CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable and largely grammatical, but it lacks a final period and does not capitalize ""Trump,"" which are minor fluency issues. Hence FS = 0.5.
Overall, the joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (0 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.5."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,People like this rarely care about facts,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic slur ""cretins"" has been replaced with the neutral term ""People,"" eliminating any insulting or hateful language, so the toxic style is fully removed (score 1). CS: Aside from the replacement of the insult, every other element—subject (“…like this”), predicate (“rarely care about facts”)—remains identical, faithfully conveying the same proposition about the group’s indifference to facts; therefore the core meaning is fully preserved (score 1). FS: The neutral sentence is well-formed, grammatically correct, and easy to read with no awkward phrasing, so fluency is perfect (score 1)."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,Do people actually believe this?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral text removes the only toxic element ('shit') and the excessive punctuation, resulting in a fully neutral sentence, so it deserves 1. CS: The interrogative meaning—questioning whether people believe something—remains intact without any loss of information, so content similarity is complete (1). FS: The revised sentence is grammatical, capitalized, and properly punctuated, exhibiting full fluency; thus FS is 1."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","Don't you ever change one of my edits, or I will come to your house and I will cut you",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA): 0 – The threatening phrase ""I will come to your house and I will cut you"" remains entirely intact, so the toxic content is not removed at all.
Content Similarity (CS): 1 – The neutral text conveys exactly the same information as the original; no semantic content was lost or altered.
Fluency (FS): 1 – Capitalization and punctuation were corrected, producing a fully grammatical, natural‐sounding sentence.
Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
even bush knows he fucked up .,even bush knows he messed up,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity ""fucked up"" has been fully replaced by the neutral phrase ""messed up,"" so all toxic wording is removed (score 1).
CS: The sentence still conveys exactly the same meaning—that even Bush acknowledges he made a mistake—so no core information is lost (score 1).
FS: The rewritten sentence is perfectly understandable and grammatically sound; the lack of initial capitalization and final period is a very minor stylistic issue that does not hinder fluency, so it warrants the top score (score 1)."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,Popeyes for doing this in the first place,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The toxic word ""fuck"" has been removed and no other offensive language remains, so the text is fully neutral (score 1).
CS: The new sentence still refers to ""Popeyes"" and to them ""doing this in the first place,"" so the topic and event are retained. However, the speaker’s negative attitude (condemnation) conveyed by ""fuck"" is lost; the rewritten sentence no longer expresses disapproval. Thus only partial meaning is preserved (score 0.5).
FS: The output is understandable, but it is not a complete grammatical sentence—it lacks a verb or clear predicate. This makes it somewhat awkward though still comprehensible (score 0.5)."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,"I got my butt kicked by gre practice tests, so I never make this same mistake again",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The word “ass” (mild profanity) has been replaced with the much less charged word “butt,” and no other toxic or insulting language remains, so the sentence is now neutral (score 1).
CS: The rewritten sentence conveys the same idea: the speaker was badly affected by GRE practice tests and therefore will avoid repeating the mistake. No key information has been added or removed (score 1).
FS: The sentence is understandable and mostly grammatical, but there is a slight tense/aspect mismatch (""so I never make this same mistake again"" would read more fluently as ""so I will never make"" or ""so I don’t make""). This small issue lowers naturalness a bit, so fluency is rated 0.5 rather than 1.
Overall, the joint average score is (1 + 1 + 0.5)/3 = 0.83."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,getting stronger every month yeah i wish,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the expletive ""fucking"". It has been completely removed, and no other aggressive or derogatory language remains, so the detoxification is fully successful (score 1). CS: Aside from deleting the swear word, every other word is retained. The sarcastic sense of wishing for continual improvement is still conveyed, so the core meaning is fully preserved (score 1). FS: The sentence is understandable, but it lacks proper capitalization and punctuation, and the phrase order is a bit abrupt (‘getting stronger every month yeah i wish’). These minor grammatical issues reduce smoothness, so fluency is rated as partially acceptable (score 0.5)."
have you ever been to r trees and seen all the shit people say weed can do ? .,Have you ever been to r trees and seen all the things people say weed can do?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""shit"" has been replaced by the neutral word ""things,"" removing all offensive language, so the detoxification is successful (score 1). CS: The sentence still conveys the same idea—asking whether the reader has seen all the claims about what weed can do on r/trees—so the core meaning is fully preserved (score 1). FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and reads smoothly (score 1). Therefore, the joint average score is 1.0."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .",A cop got fired?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The phrase “holy shit” is the only toxic element (profanity) in the original sentence. It has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so STA = 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys the same core idea—expressing surprise or asking whether a police officer was fired—so the essential information and intent are preserved. No core information is lost, hence CS = 1.
FS: “A cop got fired?” is a fully grammatical, fluent sentence with correct punctuation and capitalization. There are no errors that hinder readability, so FS = 1."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,How do you manage that?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic profanity ""fuck"" has been completely removed, and no other offensive language remains, so the neutral text is fully non-toxic.
CS: Aside from deleting the profanity, the sentence still asks exactly the same question about how someone manages something, so the core meaning is entirely preserved.
FS: ""How do you manage that?"" is a grammatically correct, natural-sounding English sentence with proper capitalization and punctuation, hence fully fluent."
how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,how do you think people afford houses and cars ?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the expletive ""fuck."" The neutral text removes this word completely, leaving no toxic or offensive language. Therefore, STA = 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the offensive word, the neutral text keeps every other word and preserves the full meaning—asking how people can afford houses and cars. No information is lost, so CS = 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is short, grammatical, and easy to read. While it starts with a lowercase letter and contains a space before the question mark, these are minor stylistic issues that do not impair comprehension or grammaticality. Hence FS = 1."
i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,I accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost panicked,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The vulgar phrase ""shit my pants"" is the only toxic element in the original. It was replaced with the neutral word ""panicked,"" so all toxicity is removed — score 1.
CS: The sentence still conveys that the speaker misread the title as ""laser machete"" and had an intense emotional reaction. No core information is lost — score 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, correctly capitalized, and easy to read; no fluency problems are present — score 1."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,I did not vandalize anything,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive term “dick” has been entirely removed and no other toxic language remains, so the output is fully neutral (score 1).
CS: The source sentence’s core proposition—denial of vandalism—is fully preserved. The vocative insult does not convey substantive information, so its removal does not alter the meaning (score 1).
FS: ""I did not vandalize anything"" is a well-formed, grammatical sentence with correct capitalization; even without a final period it reads naturally. Thus, fluency is high (score 1)."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,I don't care about sides,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The vulgar phrase “don’t give a flying fuck” has been fully replaced with the neutral expression “don’t care,” removing all profanity. Therefore, toxic content is completely eliminated (score 1).
CS: The original message conveys indifference toward sides. The neutral sentence keeps exactly that meaning with no loss or change (score 1).
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and easy to read; there are no fluency issues (score 1)."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,I have toilet paper to wipe my bottom and no shortage of food,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""ass"" has been replaced by the neutral word ""bottom,"" removing the profanity entirely. No other toxic elements remain, so STA = 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence conveys exactly the same factual content (having toilet paper, its intended use, and no shortage of food). No information is lost or added, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is well-formed, capitalized, and easily understandable; the only minor issue is the absence of a final period, but that does not hinder readability. Therefore, FS = 1."
i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but fucking seriously .,I mean it's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but seriously,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the original sentence is the swear word ""fucking."" It has been fully removed in the neutral version, leaving no toxic or offensive language, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from removing the swear word, all other words and the syntactic structure remain intact. The statement about the pope being cool and awesome is preserved, therefore the core meaning is unchanged. CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and easily readable. Although it is somewhat colloquial and repetitive (""awesome … awesome""), it contains no errors that hinder comprehension. Thus, Fluency is fully acceptable. FS = 1."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","I sell quite a bit of things on there, and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""shit"" has been replaced with the neutral term ""things,"" eliminating the profanity entirely, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1). CS: Apart from that lexical substitution, all information (selling items, using PayPal to pay bills) is completely preserved, so the core meaning is unchanged (score 1). FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical and natural; capitalization of ""paypal"" could be improved but does not hinder readability, so overall fluency is high (score 1)."
"if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the shit out of him .","if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute him",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element is the profanity phrase ""the shit out of him."" This has been fully removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so STA = 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence still states that if he is found to have acted in cold blood, the federal authorities will persecute him. The core proposition and all factual information are preserved; only the emphatic profanity is lost, which does not change the essential meaning. Hence CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but has minor grammatical issues: missing apostrophes in ""hes"" (should be ""he's""), and awkward spacing around commas. These do not block comprehension but affect polish, so FS = 0.5."
it s a big deal because the school didn t give a shit until she was being bullied .,it s a big deal because the school didn t care until she was being bullied,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic phrase ""didn’t give a shit"" is fully replaced with the neutral phrase ""didn’t care."" No insulting or profane language remains, so the toxic style is completely removed (score 1).
CS: The rewritten sentence conveys exactly the same meaning: the school’s lack of concern until bullying occurred is still emphasized. No information is lost or added (score 1).
FS: The sentence is understandable and flows well, but the apostrophes are missing in contractions (""it s"", ""didn t""), which are grammatical inaccuracies. Because of these minor errors, the fluency is not perfect but still acceptable (score 0.5)."
"judging by the shit i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .","judging by the things i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive word ""shit"" was replaced with the neutral word ""things"" and no other toxic language remains, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1).
CS: All informational elements (judging by, things seen, number of years, time spent with George W.) are retained; replacing ""shit"" with ""things"" does not change the core meaning, so content is fully preserved (score 1).
FS: The sentence is understandable but remains a fragment (missing a main verb after the comma, no final period). Minor punctuation and capitalization issues (""i ve"" instead of ""I've""). These errors hurt fluency but do not make it incomprehensible, warranting a partial score (0.5)."
"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up","Last warning, it takes minutes to resolve a page so people like you can mess up Wikipedia",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All explicitly toxic words (""fucking"", ""tosser"", ""cunts"", ""fuck"") have been removed or softened to non-toxic equivalents (""people"", ""mess up""). No new toxic language is introduced, so the detoxification is complete → 1.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the core propositions: (1) it is a last warning, (2) it takes only minutes to resolve a page, (3) the addressee is able to mess up Wikipedia. Losing the word ""me"" before ""minutes"" is a negligible detail; the causal meaning and threat remain intact → 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical and easily readable. Punctuation could be improved with a full stop instead of a comma, but this does not hinder comprehension, and no grammatical errors are present → 1."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .",Justin is not telling the truth,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic insult 'liar, liar pants on fire' is replaced by the neutral statement 'is not telling the truth.' The wording no longer contains mockery or name-calling, so toxicity is fully removed → 1.
CS: Both sentences convey the same core information—that Justin is lying. No important information is lost or added → 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and natural: 'Justin is not telling the truth.' No fluency issues → 1."
my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,My thoughts are that our new guy might be even worse,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic epithet “dirt bag” has been removed and replaced with the neutral phrase “even worse,” which conveys criticism without abusive language. Therefore the detoxification is complete → 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence still expresses the speaker’s opinion that the new person may be worse than another reference point, preserving the core meaning of negative evaluation. No essential information is lost → 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and easy to read; the only minor issue is the missing final period, which does not impede comprehension, so it is judged fully fluent → 1."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","No way number bricks fits in a car, this is bs",0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA: The strong profanity ""fucking"" was removed, but the vulgar term ""bs"" (short for ""bullshit"") is still present, so toxicity is only partially eliminated → 0.5.
CS: Aside from dropping the swear word, every piece of semantic content (disbelief that a certain number of bricks can fit in a car) is preserved → 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it lacks an article or clearer structure (""No way number bricks fits…"" should be ""No way a/the number of bricks fits…""), and ends with the informal fragment ""this is bs"". These issues hurt polish but do not make it unintelligible → 0.5."
noones asking you to invade shit .,noones asking you to invade things,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The explicit profanity 'shit' is replaced with the neutral word 'things'; no other toxic wording remains, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1).
CS: Aside from substituting a vulgar placeholder with a neutral one, the sentence still conveys the same idea—nobody is asking the listener to invade anything—so the core meaning is fully preserved (score 1).
FS: The output is understandable but not fully grammatical. It lacks the apostrophe in ""no one's,"" capitalisation at the beginning, and terminal punctuation, so it is only partly fluent (score 0.5)."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,not around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic element is the profanity ""fucking"". It has been completely removed, leaving no offensive language, so STA = 1.
CS: The original means ""not messing around in foreign matters..."". The neutral sentence drops the colloquial verb ""messing/fucking around"" and keeps only ""not around"", which changes the meaning (it now could mean physically not present rather than not interfering). Core idea of non-involvement is partly retained but nuance is lost, so CS = 0.5.
FS: The result is understandable but ungrammatical: ""not around in foreign matters"" lacks a main verb or clear structure (should be ""We should not be around"" or similar). Hence it is readable but awkward, giving FS = 0.5."
nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady as fuck .,nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The sole toxic element, the profanity ""as fuck,"" has been entirely removed. The resulting sentence is neutral, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the profane intensifier, all informational content (missing footage, unaccounted-for time, and the implication that it will look shady) is retained. No core meaning is lost, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, understandable, and reads smoothly. Although it begins with a lowercase letter, this minor stylistic issue does not impede fluency. Therefore FS = 1.
Overall, the average (joint) score is (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1.0."
number will solve alot of fucking problems if it comes down to it .,Number will solve a lot of problems if it comes down to it,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the expletive ""fucking"". It has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from removing the swear word, every other word and the overall proposition (that ‘number will solve a lot of problems if necessary’) is preserved. No information is lost, so CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it is slightly ungrammatical because it lacks an article before ""Number"" (more natural would be ""A number"" or ""The number""). This minor error lowers fluency, so FS = 0.5.
Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random shit like this .,org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random things like this,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic word ""shit"" has been completely replaced by the neutral word ""things,"" and no other offensive language remains, so the style transfer is fully successful (1).
CS: Aside from the profanity change, the sentence keeps the same proposition: that Wikipedia contains articles about many random items. No core information is lost, so content similarity is fully preserved (1).
FS: The sentence is understandable but has minor grammatical issues: missing apostrophes in ""there s"" and no closing period. These small errors lower overall fluency, so it earns 0.5.
The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
"ouch man , them swedes were dicks to norway =\","ouch man , them swedes were bad to norway =\",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only overtly toxic word in the source is ""dicks"". It has been replaced by the neutral term ""bad"", eliminating the offensive content without introducing new toxicity, so STA = 1.
CS: Aside from the substitution of the insult, all information is preserved: it still expresses surprise/pain (""ouch man""), identifies Swedes as the agents, and states they behaved poorly toward Norway. Therefore CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but not fully fluent. Colloquial phrasing like ""them swedes"" and the odd preposition ""bad to Norway"" sound ungrammatical, and punctuation is sloppy (space before comma, stray back-slash). These issues reduce naturalness, so FS = 0.5."
people are idiots for wasting emergency call time on crap like this .,People are wasting emergency call time on this,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic words ""idiots"" and ""crap"" are completely removed and no new toxic language is introduced, so the detoxification is fully successful (1). CS: The core proposition that people are wasting emergency call time remains intact. The lost elements (""idiots"", ""crap like this"") are evaluative/toxic rather than factual, so the main meaning is preserved (1). FS: The sentence is short, grammatically correct, and fully understandable, with no awkward phrasing (1). Therefore the average joint score is 1.0."
"quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some idiot hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .","quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some hierarch , even unto being killed , like st",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the insult 'idiot'. This word is completely removed in the neutral version and no new toxic content is introduced, so the style transfer accuracy is 1.
CS: Aside from removing the insult, every informational element (saints are canonized, opposition to a hierarch, martyrdom, example introduced by 'like st') is preserved. Hence the core meaning remains intact, yielding a content-similarity score of 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it still has several fluency problems: extra spaces before commas, lack of initial capitalization, and it ends abruptly with 'like st' (missing completion and final punctuation). These issues make the text somewhat awkward though still comprehensible, so fluency receives 0.5.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
read your own fucking link .,Read your own link,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity ""fucking"" has been removed, and the sentence is now fully neutral, so STA = 1. CS: Aside from removing the toxic adjective, the command 'Read your own link' conveys the exact same meaning as the toxic source, so CS = 1. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, correctly capitalised, and easy to understand; the lack of a final period is minor and does not impede readability, so FS = 1."
same crap going on in the pnw too .,same thing going on in the pnw too,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic word ""crap"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""thing,"" and the rest of the sentence does not contain any offensive language, so toxic content is fully removed (1.0).
CS: Aside from the lexical substitution of ""crap"" with ""thing,"" the sentence still communicates that the same situation is occurring in the PNW as before; no core meaning is lost (1.0).
FS: The sentence is understandable and grammatically clear, but it is a sentence fragment lacking capitalization at the beginning and punctuation at the end, which counts as minor grammatical issues (0.5)."
"shit , i d love an number pm sunset .",I would love an number pm sunset,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only overtly toxic element in the source sentence is the swear word ""shit"". It has been completely removed, and no new toxic language was introduced, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the swear word, the rewritten sentence keeps all remaining words (""I would love an number pm sunset""), therefore the core meaning — a desire for a number at a specified time (pm) at sunset — is preserved. No semantic content was lost or added, so CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but not fully grammatical: the article–noun combination ""an number"" is incorrect; the phrase ""number pm sunset"" is awkward and lacks clear structure; punctuation is missing. Because of these noticeable but non-blocking issues, the fluency is judged as partially acceptable, giving FS = 0.5."
some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped in the ass .,Some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The neutral sentence still contains the explicitly violent and abusive phrase ""to get raped."" No meaningful reduction of toxicity occurred (only the anatomical detail was dropped), so Style Transfer Accuracy = 0.
CS: Aside from omitting the words ""in the ass,"" the neutral sentence conveys exactly the same scenario (a man robs a liquor store for $400 and is raped in prison). The core meaning is fully preserved, so Content Similarity = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, well-formed, and easy to read. Therefore Fluency = 1."
"someone says no , and they say fuck off we need vets only for free housing ? .","someone says no , and they say we need vets only for free housing ?",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence completely removes the toxic phrase “fuck off,” and no other offensive language remains, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1. 
CS: Aside from deleting the profane words, all informational content (‘someone says no’, ‘they say we need vets only for free housing’) is preserved, so Content Similarity is 1. 
FS: The sentence is understandable, but punctuation and word order are awkward (extra spaces before commas/question marks, missing capitalization, overall clunky structure). These issues lower readability, so Fluency is rated 0.5 rather than 1. 
Joint score is the average: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,still standing up for your leader who loves himself and nobody else,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic descriptors ""lying"" and ""crazy"" have been removed, and the remaining wording is not overtly abusive or hateful, so the sentence is now neutral – score 1.
CS: While the main idea (someone keeps supporting a self-absorbed leader) is preserved, the specific claims that the leader is a liar and crazy are lost. Because these attributes are factual content (not merely toxic markers) their removal means partial loss of meaning – score 0.5.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, clear, and fully understandable; no evident fluency issues – score 1."
sucked like nothings ever sucked before .,It was not good,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The original phrase uses the mildly vulgar expression ""sucked like nothing's ever sucked before""; the rewrite removes the vulgar wording entirely and uses neutral language, so toxic content is fully removed → 1. 
CS: The source conveys that something was extremely bad (very strong negative evaluation). The neutral text merely states ""It was not good,"" which keeps the negative sentiment but loses the strong emphasis/intensity. Because part of the meaning (degree of negative intensity) is lost, only partial preservation → 0.5. 
FS: ""It was not good"" is a short, grammatically correct sentence with no errors, hence fully fluent → 1."
taking a stand with either party is equally retarded .,Taking a stand with either party is equally bad,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The slur ""retarded"" is completely removed and replaced with the neutral word ""bad,"" eliminating toxic content entirely, so STA = 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys the core idea that siding with either party is viewed negatively; no substantive information is lost, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and easily readable (only a missing period, which does not hinder comprehension), so FS = 1."
that almost never happens excepts rarely in shit hole countries .,that almost never happens excepts rarely in countries,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The offensive phrase ""shit hole"" has been completely removed, leaving no toxic or derogatory language, so Style Transfer Accuracy = 1.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the idea that the event ""almost never happens"" but occurs ""rarely."" However, dropping the qualifier ""shit hole"" eliminates the specification that it only happens in a certain subset of countries. This alters part of the meaning, so Content Similarity is only partially preserved ⇒ 0.5.
FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable, but it contains grammatical issues (""excepts"" should be ""except,"" and ""rarely in countries"" is awkward). These errors lower readability but do not make it incomprehensible ⇒ 0.5.
Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.67."
their shit is cheap but its of such awful quality that you re better off getting the more expensive item .,their thing is cheap but its of such awful quality that you re better off getting the more expensive item,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic word ""shit"" has been replaced by the neutral word ""thing"" and no other offensive language remains, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1).
CS: Aside from the change of the single descriptive noun, the sentence still conveys exactly the same core meaning: the product is cheap but of such poor quality that buying the more expensive one is preferable. No information is lost (score 1).
FS: The sentence is understandable and largely fluent, but there are noticeable grammatical issues: ""its"" should be ""it's"" and ""you re"" is missing the apostrophe. These minor errors reduce grammatical correctness, so it receives 0.5 for fluency.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
they need stop tratening people like morons .,They need to stop treating people like they are not smart,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic term ""morons"" has been replaced with a neutral phrase ""not smart,"" completely eliminating the derogatory language.  CS: The neutral sentence conveys the same core message—that certain people should stop treating others as intellectually inferior—so the original meaning is fully preserved.  FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding (minor stylistic alternatives like ""as if they’re not smart"" would also work but are not necessary), thus it is fully fluent."
they re both fucked up .,They are both bad,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic phrase ""fucked up"" has been fully replaced with the neutral word ""bad,"" so no toxic language remains (score = 1). CS: The original sentence expresses a negative judgement about both subjects; the neutral version still conveys that negative judgement («both … bad»). Although intensity is slightly softer, the core meaning is preserved (score = 1). FS: ""They are both bad"" is a well-formed, fluent English sentence without grammatical errors (score = 1). The joint score is therefore (1+1+1)/3 = 1.0."
this guy is a total sellout with no brains for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking .,This guy is not good for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the clearly toxic phrases ""total sellout"" and ""no brains"" and uses non-insulting wording, so the toxic style is fully neutralised → 1.0.
CS: The source conveys three ideas: (1) the person is a sellout, (2) he is incompetent in business, and (3) he lacks forward thinking. The neutral text keeps (2) and (3) but omits the ‘sellout’ notion, so part of the original semantic content is lost → 0.5.
FS: The sentence is understandable but slightly awkward: ""lacks the ability of forward thinking"" is non-idiomatic (should be ""ability for"" or ""ability to think ahead""). Minor grammatical stiffness lowers naturalness → 0.5."
"this is a joke , are you all fucking retards ? .","This is a joke, are you all retards?",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic intensifier ""fucking"" was removed, but the slur ""retards"" remains, so toxicity is only partly mitigated → 0.5.
CS: Aside from deleting the word ""fucking"" (an intensifier that does not change the core proposition), the sentence keeps the full original meaning (the speaker claims it is a joke and asks the same question) → 1.0.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical and easily readable; punctuation is acceptable, and there are no major errors → 1.0."
this is some twilight zone shit,This is some twilight zone thing,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The original toxic element is the profanity ""shit"". It has been replaced with the neutral word ""thing"", so all toxicity is removed (score 1).
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the same structure and conveys the same idea that something feels like it belongs in ""The Twilight Zone"" (i.e., it is strange or surreal). The loss of the expletive does not change the propositional content, so the core meaning is fully preserved (score 1).
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and easy to read. There are no errors that hinder comprehension (score 1)."
this shit is overwhelming to think about .,This is overwhelming to think about,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive word “shit” was removed, leaving a fully neutral sentence, so toxic content is completely eliminated. CS: Aside from deleting the profanity, the sentence’s meaning—that something is overwhelming to contemplate—remains fully intact. FS: The resulting sentence is grammatically correct, well-formed, and natural sounding. Hence all three dimensions merit full scores."
what an arse hole you are !,You are not a good person,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The original insult ""arse hole"" is fully removed; the rewritten sentence contains no profanity or slurs, so it is neutral in tone (score = 1). CS: The core meaning—telling the addressee they are morally bad—is preserved; although the wording is milder, the semantic content (a direct negative judgment) remains intact (score = 1). FS: The sentence ""You are not a good person"" is grammatically correct, clear, and natural (score = 1). Consequently, the average joint score is 1.0."
"whats the title of this report , no shit ? .","whats the title of this report , really ?",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic expression “no shit” has been completely replaced by the neutral intensifier “really,” so all toxicity is removed -> 1.  CS: The rewritten sentence still asks for the report’s title and conveys the same incredulous tone; no core information is lost -> 1.  FS: The sentence is understandable but contains minor grammatical/punctuation issues (missing apostrophe in “what’s,” extra spaces before commas) that prevent it from being fully fluent -> 0.5."
why the fuck does everyone hate syria so much ? .,why does everyone hate syria so much ?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The phrase “the fuck” is the only toxic element in the source sentence and it has been removed completely, leaving a neutral sentence, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the expletive, all words and the full intent (“Why does everyone hate Syria so much?”) are kept intact. No information is lost, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically sound, clear, and fully understandable. Minor stylistic choices such as lowercase initial letter do not impede fluency. Therefore FS = 1."
why the fuck haven 't they condemned north korea ?,Why haven't they condemned north korea?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The obscene word ""fuck"" has been completely removed and no other toxic language appears, so the text is fully neutral (score 1).
CS: The neutral sentence asks exactly the same question—why they have not condemned North Korea—so all semantic content is retained (score 1).
FS: The sentence is clear and easily understandable, but the proper noun ""North Korea"" should be capitalized. This minor orthographic error lowers fluency slightly, warranting 0.5 rather than 1. There are no other grammatical issues."
"yeah , comparitively fuck all because they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and smart accountants ? .","Yeah, comparitively nothing because they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and smart accountants?",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element was the expletive ""fuck"". It has been replaced with the neutral word ""nothing"", and no other offensive language remains, so the toxic style is fully removed (score 1).
CS: ""Fuck all"" is a colloquial way to say ""nothing"". By substituting it with ""nothing"" the rewritten sentence keeps the same meaning. All other information (offshore hidden bank accounts, smart accountants) is intact, so core meaning is entirely preserved (score 1).
FS: The sentence is understandable and mostly well-formed, but contains the misspelling ""comparitively"" (should be ""comparatively"") and the punctuation is slightly awkward (comma usage and a trailing question mark for what reads more like a statement). These minor issues lower fluency, so it is rated partially fluent (score 0.5)."
yeah they don t give a fuck .,yeah they don't care,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""fuck"" has been completely removed and replaced with neutral language, so the sentence is no longer offensive (score 1). CS: ""They don't give a fuck"" means ""They don't care""; the rewritten sentence conveys exactly the same idea without adding or omitting key information (score 1). FS: ""yeah they don't care"" is short but grammatically correct and fully understandable; no errors hinder readability (score 1)."
yeh well ban me fukkers fuck you morons,yeh well ban me,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: All overtly toxic words (""fukkers"", ""fuck you"", ""morons"") are removed, leaving a fully neutral sentence. Hence, full score 1.
CS: The core request/challenge ""yeh well ban me"" is retained, but the original conveyed strong hostility through the insults, which is now lost. Because part of the semantic message (speaker's contempt) is removed, give 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical and easily understandable. Informal spelling of ""yeh"" is acceptable and does not hinder comprehension. No errors, so score 1."
you have got to be insane .,You have to be insane,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The neutral text still contains the direct insult ""insane,"" so no toxic content is actually removed; score = 0.  CS: Apart from changing ""have got to"" to the synonymous ""have to,"" the sentence keeps the full meaning of the original; score = 1.  FS: ""You have to be insane"" is a well-formed, fluent sentence (the missing period is a very minor punctuation issue and does not hinder readability), so it merits full fluency; score = 1."
"Goths listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop. If you want you can find sources for every shit.","Goths listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop If you want you can find sources for every thing",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic word ""shit"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""thing""; no other offensive language remains, so the transformation is fully neutral (score 1).
CS: Apart from substituting the offensive word, the sentence keeps the same information about Goths listening to Gothic rock instead of baby pop and the ability to find sources. No core meaning is lost (score 1).
FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable but has minor fluency issues: the period after ""pop"" is missing, and ""every thing"" should be the single word ""everything."" These small grammatical/punctuation problems reduce smoothness, so fluency is partial (score 0.5)."
I hate free speech it is shit.,I hate free speech it is bad,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive word ""shit"" in the source has been replaced with the neutral word ""bad"". No other profanities or slurs remain, so toxic content has been fully removed → 1.
CS: The sentence still expresses dislike for free speech and judges it negatively, exactly as in the original. No information has been added or lost → 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it is a run-on fragment lacking proper punctuation or conjunction (e.g., it should read ""I hate free speech; it is bad"" or ""I hate free speech because it is bad""). This minor grammatical issue reduces fluency → 0.5."
"Minority Breeder Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page started for him, nice job dipshit.","Minority Breeder Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page started for him, nice job",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA (1): The only explicitly toxic element in the source sentence is the insult ""dipshit."" This word has been completely removed in the neutral version, and no new toxic wording is introduced, so toxic content is fully eliminated.

CS (1): Aside from deleting the insult, every other informational element – the subject (""Minority Breeder Breeder""), the claim that he is significant, and the complaint about the page deletion – is preserved. Therefore the core meaning remains intact.

FS (0.5): The sentence is understandable, but it contains a comma-splice (""..., nice job"") and the structure ""you went and deleted"" is slightly awkward. In addition, there is no final period. These minor grammatical issues reduce overall fluency, so it is rated as partially fluent.

"This bot is seriously driving us crazy This image exists, I must kill it!","This bot is seriously driving us crazy This image exists, I must kill it!",0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The neutral text is identical to the toxic text; the violent phrase ""I must kill it!"" is still present, so no detoxification occurred (score 0). CS: Because the texts are identical, the original meaning is fully preserved (score 1). FS: The sentence is understandable, but it contains a run-on structure and missing punctuation between clauses, so it is not fully fluent (score 0.5). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (0 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.5."
Have you been fucking living under a rock?,Have you been living under a rock?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the toxic expletive ""fucking,"" resulting in a fully neutral tone, so it merits 1.0.
CS: Aside from deleting the expletive, every other word remains the same, so the question’s original meaning (asking if someone is unaware) is entirely preserved, yielding 1.0.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, natural, and fully fluent: ""Have you been living under a rock?"" Therefore, fluency is 1.0.
Overall, all dimensions score the maximum, hence the joint average score is 1.0."
"I will do Whatever i want and it is my right, what is both of yous Problem Asshole.","I will do whatever I want and it is my right, what is both of yous problem",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The explicit insult “Asshole” is completely removed and no new offensive wording is introduced, so the neutral text is fully detoxified (score 1).
CS: Apart from deleting the insult, every informational element is kept: the speaker’s intent to do whatever they want and the question about the other people’s problem. The core meaning is intact, so full similarity (score 1).
FS: The sentence is understandable, but there are noticeable fluency issues: non-standard ""yous"" instead of ""your""/""you"", comma-spliced clauses, missing final punctuation or question mark, and slight awkwardness in word order. These do not render the sentence incomprehensible but do hinder smooth reading; hence partial fluency (score 0.5)."

CS: Aside from deleting the profanity, every other word and the overall meaning (questioning how someone will block the speaker from editing) is perfectly preserved; CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, properly spells ""editing,"" and reads smoothly with no errors, thus FS = 1."
WTF How The Fuck Does This Person Merit A Page On Wikipedia.,How does this person merit a page on Wikipedia,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: All explicitly toxic words (""WTF"", ""the fuck"") have been removed, leaving a neutral formulation, so the style transfer is fully successful.
CS: The rewritten sentence still questions why the person deserves a Wikipedia page, preserving the complete original meaning; therefore full content similarity is achieved.
FS: The sentence is grammatical and easy to read, but it lacks the expected question-mark punctuation at the end (""How does this person merit a page on Wikipedia?""). This minor issue slightly detracts from perfect fluency, so a score of 0.5 is assigned."
"I'm retired, fuckers, leave me alone.","I'm retired, leave me alone",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit insult “fuckers” has been completely removed, and the resulting sentence contains no toxic or offensive language, so the style transfer is fully successful.

CS: The overall intent (inviting the person to continue so others can observe something negative about them) is preserved, but the specific characterization ""ignorant arse"" is lost, which removes part of the semantic content → 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical and easy to read; although the phrasing ""what you are"" is slightly awkward, it is still fluent English without errors → 1."

No other derogatory or hateful language remains, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1).
CS: Apart from softening the insult, all information is kept: the speaker drives a Subaru Legacy, identifies as conservative, and disagrees with the listener. The core meaning (expression of disagreement) is preserved, so full score 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but has punctuation/coordination issues (""...conservative But I still...""). These minor grammatical flaws hurt smoothness, so fluency is partial (score 0.5)."
"Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be an arse hole","Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be unsuitable",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic expression ""arse hole"" has been completely replaced by neutral wording (""unsuitable""), and no other offensive language remains, so the style transfer is fully successful.
CS: The original sentence delivers a strong personal insult ('you are an arse hole'). The neutral version still conveys a negative judgement (the addressee is ""unsuitable""), but it tones the meaning down from a personal insult to a statement of inadequacy. Core negativity toward the addressee is preserved, yet the nuance of calling the person a bad character is partly lost, so partial preservation (0.5).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical and fully readable: ""Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be unsuitable."" No awkward phrasing or errors, therefore fluent (1).
Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."

Although the phrase ""shut up"" is brusque, it is generally considered non-toxic in most detoxification schemes, so the toxic content is fully removed → 1.

"oh shit, nooooo, is someone going to spank me now?","Oh no, is someone going to spank me now?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity ""shit"" has been replaced with the neutral interjection ""no,"" fully eliminating toxic language, so STA = 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the core meaning: an exclamation of dismay followed by the same rhetorical question. Minor intensifier loss (""nooooo"") does not change the central message, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, well-punctuated, and fully understandable, so FS = 1."
steak Diane Please stop fucking up my edits on steak diane. Thank you.,Please stop messing up my edits on steak diane Thank you,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence replaces the obscene word “fucking” with the non-toxic word “messing,” eliminating all toxic language, so the style transfer is fully successful (1).
CS: All essential information is preserved—the speaker asks someone to stop altering their edits to the ‘steak diane’ page and ends with “Thank you.” Dropping the initial redundant phrase “steak Diane” does not change the meaning, so content similarity is complete (1).
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it lacks a period after ‘diane,’ and ‘Diane’ should be capitalized. These minor grammatical/punctuation issues lower smoothness, so fluency is rated as partially fluent (0.5)."
You amins are such bastards.,You amins are so bad,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive word “bastards” has been replaced by the mild phrase “so bad,” which is not considered toxic or profane. Therefore, toxic content has been fully removed, warranting a score of 1.
CS: The sentence still conveys the same core message: the speaker is criticizing the group referred to as “amins.” No key information is lost, so the content similarity is complete (score 1).
FS: The sentence is grammatical, but the word “amins” appears to be a typo or an uncommon term (probably meant to be “admins”). This slightly disrupts naturalness, though the sentence remains understandable. Hence, fluency is downgraded to 0.5.

CS: The main propositional content—asking someone to quit defacing the speaker's user page—is fully preserved; only the abusive epithet (style, not core information) is omitted, so meaning is intact (score 1). FS: ""Quit Defacing my user page"" is a short, clear, grammatically correct sentence; minor capitalization choice on ""Defacing"" does not impede readability, thus fluency is perfect (score 1)."

CS: Apart from substituting the slur with a neutral noun, the sentence keeps the same wording and meaning (speaker forgot to mention someone considered ""even sadder"") → 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it is still fragmentary/ungrammatical (""that is"" without a complement), so it is only partially fluent → 0.5.
Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
Randi was born a DICK.,Randi was born a bad person,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic slur ""DICK"" is entirely removed and replaced with non-profane wording. No offensive or hateful language remains, so the detoxification is complete (score 1).
CS: ""A dick"" in this context means an unpleasant or rude person. Rewriting it as ""a bad person"" conveys the identical judgment about Randi’s character, so the core meaning is fully preserved (score 1).
FS: The sentence ""Randi was born a bad person"" is short, grammatical, and fully understandable, with no punctuation or agreement errors (score 1)."
This is your last warning; stop being an asshole.,This is your last warning; stop being bad,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive term ""asshole"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""bad,"" eliminating explicit toxicity; no other slurs or insults remain, so STA = 1.

FS: The sentence is grammatical and easy to read (“This is your last warning; stop being bad.”), thus FS = 1."
"MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize, so fuck you.","MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize, so you",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicitly toxic phrase ""fuck you"" has been removed, and no other offensive language remains, so the detoxification is complete (score 1).  CS: The main declaration (""MY USER PAGE … I do not vandalize"") is preserved, but the clause ""so fuck you"" carried an adversarial causal relation that is now reduced to the fragment ""so you"", which drops the causal meaning entirely. Thus some semantic content is lost (score 0.5).  FS: The resulting sentence is understandable, but it contains several issues: misspelling ""WAHT"", missing punctuation, and the final fragment ""so you"" is grammatically incomplete. These problems reduce fluency but do not make the text incomprehensible (score 0.5)."

"Heh, look, not EVERYTHING is on google. you are a dumbass.","Heh, look, not EVERYTHING is on google you are wrong",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive word “dumbass” has been removed and replaced with the neutral phrase “you are wrong,” so no toxic language remains (score 1). CS: Aside from the insult, the original statement conveys that not everything is on Google and the interlocutor is mistaken; the neutral version keeps both ideas, merely swapping the toxic epithet for a neutral judgment, so the core meaning is fully preserved (score 1). FS: The sentence is understandable but missing punctuation before “you are wrong,” resulting in a run-on construction; this minor grammatical flaw lowers readability, so fluency is partial (score 0.5). Joint score is the average of the three subscores: (1 + 1 + 0.5)/3 = 0.83."
Thanks for being an ass when I tried to help.,Thanks for being ungrateful when I tried to help,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic word ""ass"" (a direct insult/profanity) is removed, but it is replaced by ""ungrateful,"" which is still an explicitly negative character judgment. While less harsh, it remains an insult and not fully neutral, so only partial detoxification (0.5).
CS: Apart from substituting the insult, the sentence keeps the same ironic structure (""Thanks for … when I tried to help"") and conveys the idea that the addressee behaved badly during the speaker's attempt to help. Core meaning preserved, so 1.
FS: ""Thanks for being ungrateful when I tried to help."" is fully grammatical and natural. No awkward phrasing or errors, so 1."
"You're a fucking moron, go read the notability guidelines.","You're not smart, go read the notability guidelines",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The aggressive slur “fucking moron” has been softened, but the sentence still directly insults the addressee with “You’re not smart.” Because a derogatory remark remains, toxic style is only partially removed → 0.5.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps both key pieces of information: (1) a negative assessment of the addressee’s intelligence, and (2) the instruction to read the notability guidelines. No core meaning is lost → 1.

Some bubble tea for you! thanks ass hole,Some bubble tea for you! thanks,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive term ""ass hole"" is completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so the detoxification is fully successful (score 1).
CS: Aside from deleting the insult—which is expected in detoxification—the offer of bubble tea and the expression of thanks remain unchanged, so the core meaning is fully preserved (score 1).
FS: The sentence is understandable and natural, but it contains a minor punctuation/capitalization issue (""thanks"" should start with a capital letter or be attached to the previous clause with a comma). Because of this small grammatical flaw, fluency is rated as 0.5 rather than 1.
Overall joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
And your dumb people fell for his shenanigans.,And your people fell for his shenanigans,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic adjective ""dumb"" has been removed, and no other insulting or aggressive wording remains, so the text is fully neutral (score 1).
CS: Apart from eliminating the insult, all informational content—namely that the listener's people fell for the subject's shenanigans—is preserved. The removal of a purely pejorative word does not alter the factual meaning, so content similarity is complete (score 1).

These people are INSANE.,These people are not normal,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The original slur ""INSANE"" (an ableist, clearly toxic term) has been softened to ""not normal."" Although less harsh, the phrase still carries a negative judgment toward the target group, so the toxic attitude is only partly removed, warranting 0.5.
CS: The rewritten sentence conveys essentially the same meaning—asserting that the people in question deviate from a perceived norm—so the core semantic content is fully preserved. Therefore, CS = 1.

No insulting slurs or profanity remain, so toxicity is fully neutralized → 1.
CS: The original sentence conveys a strong negative judgment about the addressee’s appearance and worth. The neutral sentence keeps a general negative judgment (""not good"") but drops the specific information of being ugly and a ""piece of shit."" Thus only part of the meaning (the negative assessment) is retained → 0.5.
FS: ""Did you know that you are not good?"" is grammatically correct and easily understandable, with no awkward phrasing or errors → 1.
Joint score: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
Be careful who you call a moron.,Be careful who you call a bad person,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive term ""moron"" has been replaced with the neutral phrase ""bad person,"" removing the toxic slur while retaining only a mild, non-abusive description.

"Yeah, you can fuck off incel.","Yeah, you can go away incel",0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA: The phrase ""fuck off"" has been softened to ""go away,"" reducing profanity, but the derogatory term ""incel""—a direct personal insult—remains. Therefore, toxic content is only partially removed, warranting 0.5.
CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys the same message: telling the person to leave while addressing them as ""incel."" No core information is lost, so content similarity is fully preserved (1.0).
FS: The sentence is understandable and grammatically simple, but it is slightly awkward without a comma before the vocative ""incel"" (""Yeah, you can go away, incel""). This minor punctuation/flow issue lowers fluency to 0.5 rather than 1.0.
Overall, the average (joint) score is (0.5 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.67."

FS: ""Dude calm down!!!"" is short, grammatical, and easily understandable. Minor punctuation nuance (comma after “Dude”) does not impede readability, so it is considered fully fluent -> 1."
"Some jackass vandalized the article again, can someone fix it?","Someone vandalized the article again, can someone fix it?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element ('jackass') has been removed and replaced with the neutral term 'Someone,' so the sentence is fully neutral.

CS: Because the two sentences are identical, they preserve the original meaning perfectly, so Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The sentence is syntactically correct and easy to understand, but it lacks terminal punctuation (no period) which is a minor grammatical fault, so Fluency is downgraded to 0.5.
