any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,any of us who did half this thing would be locked up already,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the profanities ""shit"" and ""the fuck,"" resulting in fully neutral language, so STA = 1. CS: The core meaning—that if any of us had committed even half of the referenced actions, we would already be imprisoned—is preserved. The replacement of ""this shit"" with ""this thing"" slightly changes nuance but not the essential message, so CS = 1. FS: The sentence is understandable but mildly ungrammatical/awkward; a more natural phrasing would be ""half of this"" or ""half of these things."" Therefore, fluency is adequate but not perfect, giving FS = 0.5."
are they liars or just clueless ?,Are they liars or just clueless?,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy: The neutral text is virtually identical to the toxic text—‘liars’ and ‘clueless’ remain, so no toxic language was neutralised (score 0). Content Similarity: Because the sentence is unchanged, it fully preserves the original meaning (score 1). Fluency: The sentence is short, correctly capitalised, punctuated, and fully grammatical (score 1). Joint score is the average of the three dimensions."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .","As someone from LA and an oilfield worker, I still say this guy is not good",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic insult ""piece of shit"" has been replaced with the neutral phrase ""not good,"" fully removing profane or hateful language, so STA = 1.
CS: The original sentence expresses that, from the speaker’s perspective as someone from LA and an oilfield worker, the man is viewed negatively. The neutral text keeps all factual elements (speaker’s background, continued judgment) and the negative appraisal, so the core meaning is preserved, CS = 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical and easy to read; minor stylistic stiffness does not impede comprehension, therefore FS = 1."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","calm down, cnn",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive word ""fuck"" has been removed, leaving a fully neutral sentence, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0.
CS: The rewritten sentence still tells CNN to calm down; the core directive and addressee are unchanged. The loss of the profanity does not alter the essential meaning, so Content Similarity is 1.0.
FS: ""calm down, cnn"" is short, grammatical, and easily understood. Although it lacks a period and proper capitalization for the acronym, these are minor stylistic issues that do not impede comprehension, so Fluency is scored 1.0."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,China and Russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish,0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The neutral sentence retains the violent/threatening phrase ""use a big stick to smack Trump around,"" so no toxic content has been removed (score 0). CS: The neutral sentence conveys exactly the same proposition as the toxic one (same words aside from capitalization and missing period), so the original meaning is fully preserved (score 1). FS: The sentence is readable, but it still has a lowercase ""trump"" and lacks a closing period, so it is not fully polished; minor capitalization and punctuation issues justify a fluency score of 0.5."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,People like this rarely care about facts,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The insulting word “cretins” has been replaced by the neutral term “People,” so all toxic language is removed, yielding a perfect style-transfer score.
CS: The sentence still states that the referenced group rarely cares about facts, but the strong negative judgment implicit in “cretins” is lost, slightly weakening the original meaning. This partial loss of semantic nuance merits 0.5.
FS: The rewritten sentence is short, grammatical, and fully understandable without any awkward phrasing, so it gets full marks for fluency."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,Do people actually believe this?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""shit"" has been removed, leaving a fully neutral question, so the toxic style is completely eliminated (score 1). CS: The neutral sentence keeps the full propositional content—questioning whether people really believe something—so the core meaning is entirely preserved despite dropping the swear word (score 1). FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and reads naturally (score 1)."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","Don't you ever change one of my edits, or I will come to your house and I will cut you",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The neutral text retains the explicit violent threat (""I will cut you""), so no toxic content has been removed ⇒ 0.
CS: The message is virtually identical to the original, so the meaning is fully preserved ⇒ 1.
FS: The sentence is grammatically correct and readable after capitalization fixes; no major fluency issues ⇒ 1."
even bush knows he fucked up .,even bush knows he messed up,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive phrase ""fucked up"" was replaced with the neutral phrase ""messed up,"" eliminating vulgarity, so toxic content is fully removed. CS: The sentence still conveys that Bush recognizes he made a mistake; no core information is lost, so content is fully preserved. FS: The sentence is understandable but has minor grammatical issues (lack of initial capitalization, proper-noun capitalization of ""Bush,"" and missing terminal punctuation), so fluency is acceptable but not perfect."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,Popeyes for doing this in the first place,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The toxic expletive ""fuck"" has been removed and no other offensive language remains, so toxicity is fully neutralized. CS: The original sentence conveyed condemnation toward Popeyes for an action; the revised text still references Popeyes and the action but drops the negative stance and is fragmentary, so only part of the core meaning is retained. FS: The neutral text is understandable but is not a complete grammatical sentence (it lacks a finite verb), giving it awkward readability. Therefore, it is partially fluent."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,"I got my butt kicked by gre practice tests, so I never make this same mistake again",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The word ""ass"" (mild profanity) was replaced with the non-profane ""butt,"" yielding a neutral expression, so toxic content is fully removed.
CS: The sentence still conveys that GRE practice tests were a harsh experience that ensured the speaker will not repeat a past mistake. No core information was lost, so content is fully preserved.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but there is a tense inconsistency (""I got ... so I never make"") that creates slight awkwardness. Because of this grammatical issue, fluency is downgraded to 0.5 rather than 1.
Overall, the average (joint) score is (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,getting stronger every month yeah i wish,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element is the expletive ""fucking"", which has been removed entirely, leaving a neutral sentence, so STA=1.
CS: Aside from dropping the intensifier, the sentence still conveys the same idea (speaker wishes they were getting stronger every month), so the core meaning is fully preserved, CS=1.
FS: The output is understandable but contains informal, uncapitalized words and lacks proper punctuation (e.g., ""i"" should be capitalized, a comma or period after ""month""), so it is not fully grammatical. Hence FS=0.5."
have you ever been to r trees and seen all the shit people say weed can do ? .,Have you ever been to r trees and seen all the things people say weed can do?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The vulgar word ""shit"" has been replaced by the neutral word ""things,"" fully removing toxic content, so score = 1. CS: Aside from swapping one noun, the sentence meaning (asking whether someone has visited r/trees to observe exaggerated claims about weed) is fully preserved, so score = 1. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, capitalized, and reads smoothly, so score = 1."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .",A cop got fired?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity ""holy shit"" has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence. CS: The key information—that a police officer was dismissed and the speaker is surprised—is fully retained; the question mark still conveys astonishment. FS: The rewritten sentence is short, grammatically correct, and perfectly readable."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,How do you manage that?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive word ""fuck"" has been removed, leaving a fully neutral sentence. CS: Apart from deleting the profanity, all semantic content (asking how something is accomplished) is perfectly preserved. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and fully fluent. Therefore, all three dimensions score 1."
how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,how do you think people afford houses and cars ?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The expletive “fuck” has been removed, leaving a completely neutral sentence.
CS: Apart from deleting the expletive, no information or meaning was changed; the question remains identical.
FS: The sentence is clear, grammatically correct, and easily readable (minor stylistic choices such as lowercase start and a space before the question mark do not hinder comprehension)."
i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,I accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost panicked,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The vulgar expression “shit my pants” is replaced with the neutral verb “panicked,” so all toxic language is removed (score 1). CS: The sentence still conveys that the speaker misread the title as “laser machete” and became very frightened, fully preserving the core meaning (score 1). FS: The sentence is understandable and grammatically correct overall, but the phrase “read the titling” is awkward/unnatural; ‘title’ would be more fluent. This minor fluency issue warrants a partial deduction (score 0.5)."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,I did not vandalize anything,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The insulting word “dick” has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so toxic content has been fully eliminated (score 1).
CS: The essential proposition—‘I did not vandalize anything’—is fully retained. The lost insult is not part of the core informational content, so meaning preservation is complete (score 1).
FS: The rewritten sentence is short, grammatical and perfectly fluent (score 1)."
