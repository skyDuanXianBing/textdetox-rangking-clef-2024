any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,any of us who did half this thing would be locked up already,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic language by replacing the profanity 'shit' with the more neutral term 'thing' and removing the intensifier 'the fuck', resulting in a completely non-toxic expression. Thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1. The core meaning—that people doing half of these actions would normally be imprisoned—is fully preserved, so Content Similarity is 1. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no fluency issues, warranting a Fluency score of 1. All three dimensions are fully satisfied, leading to a joint score of 1."
are they liars or just clueless ?,Are they liars or just clueless?,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text: 'Are they liars or just clueless?'. While the sentence is grammatically correct and fluent (FS = 1) and fully preserves the original meaning (CS = 1), it does not remove any toxic content. The terms 'liars' and 'clueless' carry negative, accusatory connotations, and the rhetorical question implies distrust or contempt. Since the rewritten text fails to eliminate the toxic tone or language, the Style Transfer Accuracy is scored as 0. Therefore, the detoxification attempt is ineffective, resulting in a low joint score despite high fluency and content preservation."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .","As someone from LA and an oilfield worker, I still say this guy is not good",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic expression 'a piece of shit' has been successfully replaced with the neutral phrase 'not good', completely removing the offensive language while maintaining a critical stance. Content Similarity (CS) is 1.0 because the core meaning—that the speaker, despite their background, holds a negative opinion of the person—remains intact; 'not good' is a sufficiently accurate rephrasing of the original sentiment in a neutral way. Fluency (FS) is 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any linguistic errors. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1.0."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","calm down, cnn",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text 'calm the fuck down, cnn.' contains a profane expression ('the fuck') that contributes to its aggressive tone. The neutral text 'calm down, cnn' successfully removes the profanity while maintaining a polite and neutral tone, achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1).

The neutral text is grammatically correct, concise, and clearly expressed, with no fluency issues (FS = 1). All three dimensions receive the highest score, resulting in a joint score of 1."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,China and Russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 0 because the neutral text is identical to the toxic text and retains the violent metaphor 'use a big stick to smack trump around', which constitutes toxic content through aggressive and demeaning language. No effort was made to remove or rephrase the hostile expression, so the style remains fully toxic. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 1 because the neutral text is exactly the same as the original, so all original meaning and information are fully preserved. Fluency (FS) is scored 1 because the sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and naturally expressed in standard English. However, despite high fluency and content preservation, the failure to detoxify the text results in a very low joint score."

do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,Do people actually believe this?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text uses the word 'shit' and excessive question marks, which convey a derogatory and emotionally charged tone. The neutral text successfully replaces 'shit' with the more neutral 'this' and reduces the multiple question marks to one, effectively removing the toxic language while maintaining a questioning tone. Thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0 as the output is fully neutral.

The original threat 'I will come to your house, and I will cut you' is preserved verbatim, which is highly toxic and violent. No effort was made to neutralize the language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 1 because the rewritten text retains all core information and meaning from the original, with no loss of content.

Content Similarity is scored 1 because the core meaning—that Bush acknowledges a mistake—remains fully preserved; 'messed up' is a semantically equivalent euphemism for 'fucked up' in this context. Fluency is scored 1 as the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and free of any linguistic errors. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,Popeyes for doing this in the first place,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 because the toxic expletive 'fuck' has been completely removed and the resulting sentence contains no offensive or toxic language, achieving a neutral tone. Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the core subject (Popeyes doing something) is preserved, the original sentiment of strong frustration or anger is lost, which was a key component of the original message.

Fluency is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and readable, despite being a fragment; it maintains natural language structure and causes no comprehension issues."

The resulting text is completely free of toxic content. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 1 because the core meaning—that the experience of performing poorly on GRE practice tests led to a strong resolution to avoid repeating the same mistake—is fully preserved.

The sentence structure is smooth and requires no correction. Therefore, all dimensions receive the highest score, resulting in a joint score of 1."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,getting stronger every month yeah i wish,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the profane expression 'i fucking wish', where 'fucking' is used as an intensifier in a sarcastic or emphatic tone. The neutral text replaces this with 'i wish', which removes the profanity and results in completely neutral language, successfully achieving style transfer without introducing any toxic content—thus, STA is 1. The core meaning—that the speaker is expressing doubt or sarcasm about getting stronger every month—is preserved, as the phrase 'i wish' can still carry sarcastic intent depending on context, and no key information is lost, so CS is 1. The neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and fully fluent, with no syntactic or lexical issues, so FS is 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."

The core meaning of the sentence — inquiring whether the reader has seen claims about weed's effects on 'r trees' (likely a typo for 'r/trees', a subreddit) — remains intact, with only a non-essential lexical change; hence, content similarity is fully preserved (CS = 1). The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, showing no fluency issues (FS = 1). All three dimensions receive the highest score, resulting in a joint score of 1."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .",A cop got fired?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the expletive 'holy shit', which expresses surprise or shock in a vulgar manner.

The core meaning—that the person had a strong, startled reaction due to a misreading—is preserved without any loss of essential information (CS = 1).

For Content Similarity (CS), while the core claim 'I did not vandalize anything' is preserved, the original text includes an emphatic retort directed at someone (the insult), which conveys emotional context and interpersonal tension that is lost in the neutral version. This constitutes a partial loss of meaning, warranting a score of 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, so it receives a score of 1.

Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the general sentiment of negative judgment about the new guy is preserved, the specific characterization implied by 'dirt bag' (suggesting moral contempt or untrustworthiness) is weakened or lost in 'even worse', which is vaguer and lacks the original's connotative strength. Thus, there is partial but not complete preservation of meaning. Fluency is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any linguistic errors."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","No way number bricks fits in a car, this is bs",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the toxic word 'fucking' has been removed, which reduces the profanity, but the phrase 'this is bs' remains, where 'bs' is an abbreviation for a vulgar expression ('bullshit'), retaining a toxic tone.

The core meaning of the sentence — that no one is asking the person to invade something — is fully preserved, with only the offensive term being replaced by a general but contextually acceptable word. Thus, Content Similarity is 1. The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no syntactic or lexical issues, so Fluency is also 1. All dimensions meet the highest standard, resulting in a joint score of 1."

For Content Similarity (CS), the core meaning is partially preserved—while the general idea of not being involved in foreign matters remains, the removal of 'fucking' slightly weakens the emphasis or intensity present in the original, which may be part of the speaker's intent; hence, some nuance is lost, leading to CS = 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct and readable, despite the slight awkwardness from omitting 'fucking' without rephrasing; the sentence structure remains intact and understandable, so FS = 1.

The original implies criticism of the hierarch, which is lost in the neutral version, leading to partial information loss.

The core meaning of the original sentence—expressing a desire for 'an number pm sunset'—is preserved despite the unclear phrase 'an number', which appears to be a typo or grammatical error in the original; since the neutral version retains this exact phrase, the intent is not altered, so content similarity is fully maintained (CS = 1). The neutral text is grammatically acceptable and readable, though 'an number' is incorrect (should be 'a number'), but since both the toxic and neutral texts contain the same error, it does not count as a degradation in fluency introduced by detoxification; thus, the output is still fluent in context (FS = 1).

some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped in the ass .,Some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 0.5 because while the neutral text removes the explicit phrase 'in the ass', which is a vulgar expression, it still retains the sexually violent implication of 'get raped', which constitutes toxic content. Therefore, the detoxification is only partial. Content Similarity is scored 1 because the core meaning—that the person robs a store and ends up in prison where they are sexually assaulted—is fully preserved; the removal of 'in the ass' does not significantly alter the intended message. Fluency is scored 1 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, syntactically sound, and fully readable. The joint score is the average of the three: (0.5 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."

still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,still standing up for your leader who loves himself and nobody else,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text successfully removes the toxic adjectives 'lying' and 'crazy', which were subjective and derogatory, resulting in a completely neutral description of the leader. Thus, STA is scored 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS), while the core idea of 'still standing up for your leader who loves himself and nobody else' is preserved, the removal of 'lying' and 'crazy' omits some of the original evaluative intent, which may be considered part of the speaker's core sentiment. This constitutes a partial loss of meaning, so CS is scored 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any linguistic issues, so FS is scored 1.0.

Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general negative sentiment is preserved, the original sentence emphasizes an extreme degree of negativity ('like nothings ever sucked before'), which is lost in the simplified 'It was not good'. This results in a significant reduction in intensity and specificity, leading to partial meaning preservation. Fluency (FS) is 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding in English. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1)/3 = 0.83."

Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general idea that something rarely happens is preserved, the original text specifically emphasized extremely poor or undesirable countries through the derogatory term, which is lost in the neutral version—this diminishes the intended emphasis or nuance, leading to partial meaning loss. Fluency (FS) is scored 0.5 due to the grammatical error 'excepts rarely', which should be 'except rarely' (‘excepts’ is incorrect usage); despite this, the sentence remains understandable. Overall, the rewrite removes toxicity effectively but with some cost to meaning preservation and grammatical correctness."

they need stop tratening people like morons .,They need to stop treating people like they are not smart,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic content present in the original sentence. The original uses derogatory language ('morons') and misspelled words ('tratening', 'stop' instead of 'to stop'), which convey a disrespectful tone. The rewritten version replaces 'morons' with the more neutral and respectful 'not smart', effectively eliminating the offensive style while maintaining a neutral tone, thus earning a Style Transfer Accuracy of 1.0. The core meaning—that people are being treated in a condescending or unintelligent manner—is preserved without addition or omission of key information, warranting a Content Similarity score of 1.0. Despite minor simplification, the intent and message remain intact. The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and easily understandable, with only a slight informality in phrasing ('like they are not smart') that does not impair fluency.

For Content Similarity (CS), while the general negative sentiment is preserved, the original phrase 'fucked up' conveys a stronger degree of psychological or emotional dysfunction, which is significantly downplayed by the vague term 'bad'. This leads to a partial loss of meaning, warranting a score of 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral sentence 'They are both bad' is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, so it receives a score of 1.0.

Content Similarity (CS) is 1.0 because the core meaning—that the person lacks business acumen and forward-thinking ability—is fully preserved; 'lacks the ability of forward thinking' is retained verbatim and the first part conveys a similar evaluation in milder terms. Fluency (FS) is 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally. The phrase 'ability of forward thinking' is slightly less common than 'ability for forward thinking' but does not constitute a significant grammatical error, so it does not affect fluency. Overall, the rewrite is effective, neutral, and well-formed."

For Content Similarity (CS), while the core intent of issuing a final warning is preserved, the replacement of 'asshole' with 'bad' results in a significant softening of tone and imprecision in meaning—'asshole' conveys a specific interpersonal disrespect that 'bad' does not fully capture, leading to partial meaning loss, hence a score of 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally, so it receives a full score of 1.0. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
"MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize, so fuck you.","MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize, so you",0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 0.5 because the toxic expression 'fuck you' has been partially mitigated by replacing it with 'you', but the abrupt truncation leaves the intent potentially hostile and the removal is incomplete or awkward, not fully achieving a neutral tone. Content Similarity is 1 because the core message — asserting control over one's user page, denying vandalism, and expressing defiance — is fully preserved; only the profanity is altered. Fluency is 0.5 because while the sentence is mostly understandable, the phrase 'so you' at the end is grammatically incomplete and awkward, disrupting the flow and sounding unnatural, indicating a minor but noticeable language issue."
I am Nancy and I like to fuck up people's fun.,I am Nancy and I like to ruin people's fun,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the phrase 'fuck up people's fun', which is a vulgar expression. The neutral text replaces it with 'ruin people's fun', which conveys the same meaning in a non-toxic, neutral manner. Therefore, the style transfer accuracy is 1.0 as all toxic content is successfully removed and the language is completely neutral. The content similarity is 1.0 because the core meaning—Nancy enjoying disrupting others' enjoyment—is fully preserved without any significant information loss. The fluency score is 1.0 because the rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and fully readable. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1.0."
"Heh, look, not EVERYTHING is on google. you are a dumbass.","Heh, look, not EVERYTHING is on google you are wrong",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text successfully removes the highly offensive term 'dumbass' and replaces it with 'you are wrong', which is significantly less toxic and maintains a neutral tone. Therefore, STA is scored 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS), the core idea that the person is incorrect about the comprehensiveness of Google is preserved, but the original insult 'dumbass' carried a stronger judgment of the person's intelligence, which is now softened to a mere factual correction. This results in partial meaning preservation, hence CS is 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text lacks proper punctuation between 'google' and 'you', making it read as a run-on sentence. While it is understandable, this grammatical issue reduces fluency, warranting a score of 0.5."
Thanks for being an ass when I tried to help.,Thanks for being ungrateful when I tried to help,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully replaces the toxic term 'ass' with the non-toxic and more neutral expression 'ungrateful', which conveys a similar sentiment of disappointment without using offensive language, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning—that the person being addressed responded poorly when offered help—is preserved, and 'ungrateful' is a reasonable interpretation of the implied behavior in the original, so content similarity is fully maintained (CS = 1). The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, showing no fluency issues (FS = 1). All three dimensions are satisfied at the highest level."
"You're a fucking moron, go read the notability guidelines.","You're not smart, go read the notability guidelines",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 because the toxic expression 'fucking moron' has been successfully replaced with the neutral phrase 'not smart', removing the profanity and offensive tone while keeping the intent of criticism. Content Similarity is 1.0 because the core message — that the person lacks understanding and should read the notability guidelines — is fully preserved; 'not smart' conveys a similar level of intellectual critique as 'moron' without the vulgarity. Fluency is 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1.0."
Some bubble tea for you! thanks ass hole,Some bubble tea for you! thanks,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the offensive term 'ass hole', which is successfully removed in the neutral text, resulting in a completely neutral expression.

And your dumb people fell for his shenanigans.,And your people fell for his shenanigans,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the derogatory term 'dumb people,' which contributes a negative and offensive tone. The neutral text removes 'dumb' and becomes 'your people,' which successfully eliminates the toxic content while maintaining a neutral tone, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning—that a group of people was deceived by someone's tricks ('shenanigans')—is preserved without significant alteration, so content similarity is fully maintained (CS = 1). The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no fluency issues (FS = 1). All three dimensions score perfectly, resulting in a joint score of 1."
These people are INSANE.,These people are not normal,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'INSANE' and replaces it with a more neutral phrase 'not normal', resulting in a completely non-toxic statement. Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the general idea that these people are behaving unusually is preserved, the intensity and emotional charge of 'INSANE' is significantly downplayed by 'not normal', leading to some loss of the original meaning and nuance. Fluency is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and easily understandable without any language issues."
Did you know that you are an ugly piece of shit?,Did you know that you are not good?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text completely removes the toxic language such as 'ugly piece of shit' and replaces it with a non-offensive expression, resulting in a fully neutral tone. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general intent of expressing a negative evaluation is preserved, the intensity and specificity of the original insult are significantly weakened—'not good' is much milder and vaguer than the original, leading to partial loss of core meaning. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding in English. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."

Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general cautionary message is preserved, the meaning is somewhat altered: 'moron' specifically implies low intelligence, whereas 'bad person' refers to moral character, leading to a shift in the intended criticism. This constitutes a partial but notable change in meaning. Fluency (FS) is 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding with no linguistic issues. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
"Yeah, you can fuck off incel.","Yeah, you can go away incel",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the offensive phrase 'fuck off', which is a clear expression of hostility and vulgarity. In the neutral text, this is replaced with 'go away', which conveys a similar dismissive intent but in a non-toxic, socially acceptable manner. Thus, the style transfer accuracy is 1.0 as all toxic content has been successfully removed and the language is completely neutral. The content similarity is also 1.0 because the core meaning—expressing a desire for someone to leave or be gone—remains intact, and the term 'incel' is preserved, maintaining the referential context. The fluency score is 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and free of any linguistic errors. The joint score is therefore the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
"Stop defending pedophiles, faggot.",Stop defending pedophiles,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic term 'faggot', which is a homophobic slur, resulting in language that is completely neutral. The phrase 'Stop defending pedophiles' is not inherently toxic as it expresses a moral stance against a universally condemned act, so its retention does not violate neutrality. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core message of opposing the defense of pedophiles is preserved, the original sentence includes a direct personal attack ('faggot') that conveyed strong hostility toward the addressee. Removing this changes the interpersonal tone and intent to some extent, leading to partial but not complete preservation of meaning. Fluency (FS) is 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and fully readable without any linguistic errors."

Content Similarity is scored 1 because the core meaning—that no one is vandalizing certain individuals—is preserved; the change from 'assholes' to 'people' removes the derogatory element without altering the essential message. Fluency is scored 1 as the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fully readable, with no structural or linguistic issues. The joint score is the average of the three dimensions, which is (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
"DUDE CALM THE FUCK DOWN!!!
",Dude calm down!!!,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the toxic expression 'CALM THE FUCK DOWN' has been successfully rewritten to 'calm down', removing the profanity while maintaining the intent of the message. The resulting text is completely neutral, warranting a score of 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS), the core meaning — urging someone to calm down — is fully preserved; only the intensity of language is reduced, not the intent or message, so the score is 1.0. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and fully readable, thus receiving a score of 1.0. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1.0."
"Some jackass vandalized the article again, can someone fix it?","Someone vandalized the article again, can someone fix it?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic term 'jackass' has been successfully removed and replaced with the neutral 'someone', eliminating the offensive language while keeping the sentence otherwise unchanged.

I'm afraid I can't verify it as his myspace account has been deleted I fucking hate you.,I'm afraid I can't verify it as his myspace account has been deleted I hate you,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the original toxic text contains the strong profanity 'I fucking hate you'. The neutral text replaces 'fucking' with a cleaner expression 'I hate you', which reduces the intensity but still retains the emotionally charged phrase 'hate you'. Since hatred is a negative sentiment and borders on toxic language, the detoxification is only partially successful, warranting a score of 0.5. For Content Similarity (CS), the core meaning — inability to verify due to a deleted MySpace account and the speaker's strong negative feeling toward the addressee — is fully preserved; only a modifier ('fucking') is removed, so the score is 1. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally, so it receives a score of 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (0.5 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
He deserves every beating and rape he will be subjected to.,He deserves every beating and rape he will be subjected to,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 0 because the neutral text is identical to the toxic text, except for the missing period at the end, and it retains extremely harmful and toxic content such as 'every beating and rape he will be subjected to.' This language is violent and abusive, and no detoxification has occurred. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 1 because the neutral text preserves the exact meaning and core information of the original sentence—there is no rephrasing or modification that alters the intent. Fluency (FS) is scored 1 because the sentence is grammatically correct and readable, despite the missing period being a minor punctuation issue that does not affect overall fluency.
