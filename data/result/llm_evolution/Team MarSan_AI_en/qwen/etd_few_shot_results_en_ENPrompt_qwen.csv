any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,any of us who did half this thing would be locked up already,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the vulgar expressions 'shit' and 'the fuck' by replacing them with 'thing' and omitting the intensifier, resulting in completely neutral language (STA: 1.0). However, 'thing' is more vague than 'shit' in this context, which carried a strong connotation of disapproval or severity; thus, some nuance and intensity of the original meaning is lost, leading to partial preservation of meaning (CS: 0.5). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and easily understandable, with natural phrasing (FS: 1.0)."
are they liars or just clueless ?,Are they liars or just clueless?,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text, with only capitalization and punctuation slightly adjusted. The terms 'liars' and 'clueless' remain unchanged, which are accusatory and carry a derogatory tone, thus failing to remove the toxic content. Therefore, Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 0.0. However, the core meaning is fully preserved, earning a Content Similarity score of 1.0. The sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, so Fluency receives 1.0."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .","As someone from LA and an oilfield worker, I still say this guy is not good",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the highly offensive phrase 'a piece of shit' and replaces it with the milder 'not good', making the language completely neutral and appropriate, thus earning a full score for Style Transfer Accuracy. However, the replacement weakens the strength of the original sentiment — the original expression conveyed strong disapproval or contempt, which is significantly diluted in the neutral version, resulting in partial loss of the original meaning and hence a CS score of 0.5. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural, so Fluency is rated 1.0. The joint score is the average of the three: (1.0 + 0.5 + 1.0) / 3 = 0.83."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","calm down, cnn",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'the fuck' is successfully removed and replaced with a neutral imperative 'calm down', resulting in completely neutral language. The core meaning of urging CNN to calm down is fully preserved without any significant information loss. The neutral text is grammatically correct, concise, and fluent. This represents a successful detoxification with no degradation in meaning or language quality."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,China and Russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text, with only the capitalization of 'china' and 'russia' corrected, which does not address the toxic content. The phrase 'use a big stick to smack trump around' is aggressive and metaphorically violent, and remains unchanged, so no detoxification has occurred. Thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is 0.0. The original meaning is fully preserved, earning a Content Similarity of 1.0. The sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, earning a Fluency score of 1.0."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,People like this rarely care about facts,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic term 'cretins' has been successfully replaced with the neutral 'People like this', effectively removing the offensive language while maintaining a completely neutral tone. The core meaning—that individuals of a certain type generally disregard facts—is preserved without distortion. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, with no structural or linguistic issues. Therefore, all dimensions receive the highest score."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,Do people actually believe this?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the vulgar language ('shit') and excessive punctuation, resulting in a completely neutral tone, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. The core idea of questioning whether people believe something is preserved, but the intensity and emotional emphasis conveyed by 'this shit' and the triple question marks are significantly reduced, leading to some loss of the original expressive force and intent. Therefore, content similarity is partially preserved. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, with no language errors."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","Don't you ever change one of my edits, or I will come to your house and I will cut you",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text fails to remove toxic content, as the threat 'I will come to your house and I will cut you' remains unchanged and is highly aggressive and violent. Therefore, Style Transfer Accuracy is 0.0. The original meaning is fully preserved, so Content Similarity is 1.0. The text is grammatically correct and fluent, with only minor punctuation issues (missing comma before 'and'), so Fluency is 1.0. However, the lack of any detoxification renders the output ineffective for the task."
even bush knows he fucked up .,even bush knows he messed up,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'fucked up' is successfully replaced with the neutral and equivalent phrase 'messed up', completely removing the vulgar language while maintaining a completely neutral tone. The core meaning of the sentence is fully preserved, as 'messed up' conveys the same idea of making a mistake or error as the original. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and fluent, with no issues in expression or readability. Therefore, all three dimensions receive the highest score."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,Popeyes for doing this in the first place,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the profanity ('fuck') and expresses the sentiment in a completely non-toxic way, achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the original expression conveys strong negative emotion toward Popeyes' action, which is partially lost in the neutral version that simply states 'Popeyes for doing this in the first place' without clear sentiment or critique, leading to some loss in content similarity. The neutral text is grammatically correct and readable, though slightly fragmentary, but still fluent enough to understand the reference. Thus, fluency is not compromised."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,"I got my butt kicked by gre practice tests, so I never make this same mistake again",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"The toxic expression 'getting my ass kicked' is appropriately softened to 'got my butt kicked', which maintains the figurative meaning while using a less vulgar and more neutral phrasing, thus fully removing the toxic content (STA: 1.0). The core meaning—that the experience with GRE practice tests was harsh and led to a lasting behavioral change—is preserved accurately (CS: 1.0). However, the neutral text has a slight grammatical inconsistency: 'I got my butt kicked...' (past event) followed by 'so I never make this same mistake again' uses present tense 'make', which creates a minor tense mismatch. A more fluent version would use 'made' or 'will never make'. This does not impede understanding but affects fluency (FS: 0.5)."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,getting stronger every month yeah i wish,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'i fucking wish' is successfully rewritten as 'i wish', removing the profanity while maintaining a neutral tone.

Therefore, all three dimensions receive full scores."

The core meaning of the sentence — inquiring about the exaggerated claims people make regarding weed on r trees — is fully preserved. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and fluent, with no structural or syntactic issues. Therefore, all three dimensions receive the highest score."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .",A cop got fired?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'holy shit' is completely removed and the sentence is rewritten in a neutral tone as 'A cop got fired?', which conveys the same surprise without offensive language. The core meaning is fully preserved, focusing on the firing of a police officer. The neutral text is grammatically correct, concise, and fluent. Therefore, all dimensions receive the highest score."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,How do you manage that?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'how the fuck' is successfully replaced with the neutral 'How', effectively removing profanity while maintaining the original meaning of the question.

Therefore, all three dimensions receive the highest score."

The core meaning—extreme surprise or fear due to a misreading—is fully preserved. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and fluent in expression. Therefore, all dimensions receive the highest score."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,I did not vandalize anything,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the offensive term 'you dick', resulting in completely neutral language, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the original sentence includes an expressive element of frustration or emphasis toward the addressee, which is lost in the rewritten version, leading to partial meaning loss. The core claim 'I did not vandalize anything' is preserved, but the interpersonal tone and intent behind the address are omitted. The neutral text is grammatically correct and fluent, with no language errors."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,I don't care about sides,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'don't give a flying fuck' is successfully replaced with the neutral 'don't care', effectively removing the vulgar language while maintaining a completely neutral tone. The core meaning about indifference toward 'sides' is fully preserved without any loss of information. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, concise, and natural-sounding, demonstrating high fluency. Overall, this is a precise and effective detoxification."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,I have toilet paper to wipe my bottom and no shortage of food,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text uses the informal and slightly crude expression 'wipe my ass,' which is appropriately replaced with the more neutral and polite 'wipe my bottom' in the neutral text. This change successfully removes potentially offensive language while maintaining complete semantic equivalence. The rest of the sentence remains unchanged and is factually preserved. The neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and fully fluent. Therefore, all three dimensions receive the highest score."

The core meaning and context of the sentence are fully preserved, with no loss of information. The neutral text is grammatically correct, natural, and fluent. Therefore, all dimensions receive the highest score."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","I sell quite a bit of things on there, and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic term 'shit' is appropriately replaced with the neutral 'things', effectively removing the vulgar language while maintaining a completely neutral tone. The core meaning of the sentence—selling a significant amount of items and using PayPal to help pay bills—is fully preserved. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and fluent, with no structural or linguistic issues. This represents a successful detoxification with no loss in meaning or quality."
"if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the shit out of him .","if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute him",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'persecute the shit out of him' has been successfully replaced with the neutral and formal 'persecute him', completely removing the vulgar language while maintaining a completely neutral tone.

"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up","Last warning, it takes minutes to resolve a page so people like you can mess up Wikipedia",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes highly offensive language such as 'fucking tosser' and 'cunts' by replacing them with 'people like you', resulting in a completely neutral tone (STA: 1.0). The core idea—that someone is being warned about negatively impacting Wikipedia—is preserved, but the intensity and specific指责 (blame) conveyed in the original are somewhat softened, leading to partial meaning preservation (CS: 0.5). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and readable, with only minor stylistic simplification, so fluency is fully maintained (FS: 1.0)."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .",Justin is not telling the truth,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic and childish expression 'liar, liar pants on fire' and converts it into a polite, neutral statement 'Justin is not telling the truth,' achieving full style transfer. However, the original phrase carries a strong emphatic and repetitive tone implying blatant dishonesty, which is somewhat softened in the rewritten version, leading to partial loss of the original intensity and nuance—hence a CS score of 0.5. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, earning a full fluency score."
my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,My thoughts are that our new guy might be even worse,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the offensive term 'dirt bag' and replaces it with the more neutral 'even worse', making the language fully non-toxic and appropriate, thus earning a full score for Style Transfer Accuracy. However, the replacement is somewhat vague—'even worse' lacks the specific connotation of moral or behavioral disapproval implied by 'dirt bag', leading to a partial loss of the original nuance, hence the Content Similarity score of 0.5. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and natural-sounding, so Fluency is rated 1.0. The joint score is the average of the three: (1.0 + 0.5 + 1.0) / 3 = 0.83."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","No way number bricks fits in a car, this is bs",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"The toxic expression 'fucking' is removed, but the neutral text retains the abbreviation 'bs' (bullshit), which is still a vulgar and informal expression, so the style transfer is only partially successful. The core meaning is fully preserved—expressing disbelief and frustration about bricks not fitting in a car. The neutral text is grammatically correct and readable, with only minor punctuation issues (missing spaces after commas), which do not affect fluency. Therefore, STA is 0.5 due to residual informal/vulgar language, while CS and FS are both 1.0."
noones asking you to invade shit .,noones asking you to invade things,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic term 'shit' is successfully replaced with the neutral word 'things', effectively removing any vulgar or offensive language while maintaining complete neutrality.

The neutral text is grammatically correct, natural, and fluent, with no syntactic or stylistic issues. Therefore, all three dimensions receive the highest score."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,not around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the profanity 'fucking' and replaces it with a more neutral construction, achieving complete style transfer to a non-toxic form. However, the removal of 'fucking' slightly alters the emphasis and intensity of the original statement, which may carry pragmatic implications about seriousness or urgency, leading to a partial loss in content similarity. The resulting sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, though slightly less natural due to the abrupt omission of the intensifier without a direct substitute. Overall, the meaning is mostly preserved but with a subtle weakening of tone."
nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady as fuck .,nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'shady as fuck' has been successfully replaced with the neutral term 'shady', effectively removing the vulgar language while preserving the original meaning.

The sentence structure and fluency remain intact, with no grammatical errors. The rewritten text is natural and conveys the same idea in a polite and appropriate manner."
"ouch man , them swedes were dicks to norway =\","ouch man , them swedes were bad to norway =\",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"The original toxic text uses 'dicks' as a derogatory term to describe Swedes, which expresses a strong negative sentiment. The neutral text replaces 'dicks' with 'bad', which softens the language but remains vague and does not fully achieve a neutral, objective tone—'bad' still carries a negative connotation without specifying the nature of the behavior. Therefore, the detoxification is only partial, resulting in an STA score of 0.5. The core meaning—that Swedes treated Norway poorly—is preserved, so CS is 1.0. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and readable, so FS is 1.0."
people are idiots for wasting emergency call time on crap like this .,People are wasting emergency call time on this,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the insulting term 'idiots' and the dismissive word 'crap', replacing them with more neutral language, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the original meaning that criticizes people for being foolish or irresponsible in wasting emergency resources is partially lost, as the judgmental tone is weakened and the evaluative component ('idiots') is omitted, leading to a moderate loss in content similarity. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with natural expression. Therefore, STA is 1.0, CS is 0.5, and FS is 1.0."
"quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some idiot hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .","quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some hierarch , even unto being killed , like st",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text removes the potentially derogatory term 'idiot' and replaces it with a more neutral omission, resulting in completely non-toxic language, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, by removing 'idiot' without substituting a neutral descriptor, some nuance about the nature of the opposition (i.e., against a foolish or unjust authority) is lost, leading to partial meaning preservation. The sentence remains grammatically correct and fluent, with no structural or linguistic issues. The slight loss in content similarity reduces the joint score slightly."
read your own fucking link .,Read your own link,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic word 'fucking' is successfully removed and replaced with neutral language, resulting in a completely non-toxic expression. The core meaning of the sentence — urging someone to read the link they provided — is fully preserved. The neutral text is grammatically correct, concise, and fluent, with no readability issues.

same crap going on in the pnw too .,same thing going on in the pnw too,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic term 'crap' has been successfully replaced with the neutral 'thing', effectively removing the vulgar language while maintaining a completely neutral tone. The core meaning of the sentence — that a similar situation is occurring in the Pacific Northwest — is fully preserved without any loss of information. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and fluent, with no expression or structural issues. Therefore, all three dimensions receive the highest score."
"shit , i d love an number pm sunset .",I would love an number pm sunset,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic word 'shit' has been completely removed and the resulting sentence uses neutral language, successfully eliminating offensive content. The core meaning of expressing a desire for 'an number pm sunset' (likely a typo or slang for a time-related event or photo) is preserved despite the original text's informality and lack of clarity. The neutral version improves readability by removing the expletive while maintaining the intent. The output is grammatically correct and fluent, with no structural or syntactic issues. Thus, all three dimensions score perfectly."
some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped in the ass .,Some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text partially removes toxic content by omitting the vulgar phrase 'in the ass', making the expression slightly less offensive, but still retains the graphic and potentially harmful reference to prison rape, which constitutes toxic content. Thus, style transfer is only partially successful. The core meaning is fully preserved, as the key events (robbery, imprisonment, and risk of sexual violence) are unchanged, so content similarity is high. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with natural language flow. However, complete detoxification requires eliminating references to sexual violence unless absolutely necessary, which was not achieved here."
"someone says no , and they say fuck off we need vets only for free housing ? .","someone says no , and they say we need vets only for free housing ?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'fuck off' has been successfully removed and replaced with a neutral continuation of the sentence, resulting in completely neutral language. The core meaning—that someone is dismissively rejecting a 'no' in the context of advocating for veterans' access to free housing—remains fully preserved. The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, with no degradation in language quality. Therefore, all dimensions receive the highest score."
still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,still standing up for your leader who loves himself and nobody else,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic descriptors 'lying' and 'crazy' and replaces the phrase with a more neutral characterization of the leader as self-centered, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the original accusation of dishonesty ('lying') is omitted, which is a significant part of the critical meaning, leading to partial loss of content. The core idea of unwavering support for a self-centered leader is preserved, but the intensity and specific critique are softened. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with natural language flow."
sucked like nothings ever sucked before .,It was not good,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the vulgar expression 'sucked like nothings ever sucked before' and replaces it with a polite and neutral phrase 'It was not good', achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the original emphatic and extreme negative sentiment (implying something was exceptionally bad) is significantly weakened in the neutral version, resulting in partial loss of the original meaning's intensity. Thus, content similarity is only partially preserved. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with no language issues."
taking a stand with either party is equally retarded .,Taking a stand with either party is equally bad,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The word 'retarded' is a derogatory term that has been successfully replaced with the neutral term 'bad', effectively removing the toxic content and achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, 'bad' is a vague replacement that does not fully preserve the original intensity or nuance of criticism, leading to partial loss of meaning—hence content similarity is scored 0.5. The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, earning a full fluency score."
that almost never happens excepts rarely in shit hole countries .,that almost never happens excepts rarely in countries,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"The neutral text successfully removes the offensive term 'shit hole' and replaces it with a more neutral expression by omitting the derogatory modifier, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the removal of 'shit hole' results in some loss of the original emphasis on the poor conditions or negative characteristics of the countries being referred to, leading to partial preservation of meaning. Additionally, the neutral text contains a grammatical error ('excepts' should be 'except'), which affects fluency. Despite this, the sentence remains understandable, warranting a 0.5 fluency score."
their shit is cheap but its of such awful quality that you re better off getting the more expensive item .,their thing is cheap but its of such awful quality that you re better off getting the more expensive item,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic term 'shit' has been successfully replaced with the neutral term 'thing', effectively removing the vulgar language while maintaining complete neutrality. The core meaning of the sentence—that the low cost is offset by poor quality, making a more expensive alternative preferable—is fully preserved. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and fluent, with no structural or linguistic issues. Therefore, all three dimensions receive the highest score."
they need stop tratening people like morons .,They need to stop treating people like they are not smart,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic implication of calling people 'morons' by rephrasing it as 'not smart', which is a milder and more neutral expression, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. The core meaning—that people are being treated in a condescending or disrespectful way—is preserved, so content similarity is high. However, the phrasing 'like they are not smart' is somewhat awkward and less idiomatic compared to the original; a more fluent alternative might be 'like they're unintelligent' or 'without intelligence'. Despite this, the sentence remains understandable, warranting a 0.5 for fluency due to minor expression issues."
they re both fucked up .,They are both bad,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the vulgar expression 'fucked up' and replaces it with the milder term 'bad', making the language neutral and appropriate, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the original phrase 'fucked up' conveys a stronger sense of psychological or behavioral dysfunction or serious issues, which is significantly weakened by the vague term 'bad', leading to partial loss of the original meaning. The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, with no language errors. Therefore, content similarity is partially preserved, resulting in a CS score of 0.5."
this guy is a total sellout with no brains for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking .,This guy is not good for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic and derogatory expression 'total sellout with no brains for business' and replaces it with the more neutral 'not good for business,' resulting in complete detoxification (STA: 1.0). However, the original phrase carries a stronger connotation of betrayal and incompetence, which is somewhat diluted in the rewritten version, leading to a partial loss of meaning (CS: 0.5). The neutral text is grammatically correct and clearly expressed, maintaining fluency and readability (FS: 1.0)."
"this is a joke , are you all fucking retards ? .","This is a joke, are you all retards?",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text removes the profanity 'fucking' but retains the derogatory term 'retards', which is still a toxic and offensive slur. Therefore, the detoxification is only partial, resulting in a Style Transfer Accuracy score of 0.5. The core meaning of questioning others' intelligence in a mocking tone is preserved, so Content Similarity is 1.0. The sentence is grammatically correct and readable, earning a Fluency score of 1.0."

what an arse hole you are !,You are not a good person,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'arse hole' and replaces it with the more neutral 'not a good person', achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the original emphatic and strongly negative tone is somewhat softened, and the core sentiment is slightly diluted, leading to partial preservation of meaning. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with no language errors. Thus, content similarity is scored 0.5 due to the slight loss in intensity and specificity of the original insult."
"whats the title of this report , no shit ? .","whats the title of this report , really ?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The phrase 'no shit' is a mild expletive expression used for emphasis, and it has been appropriately replaced with 'really', which conveys a similar pragmatic emphasis in a neutral tone. The resulting sentence removes any potentially offensive language while preserving the original intent and meaning. The language is grammatically correct, natural, and fluent. Therefore, all three dimensions receive full scores."
why the fuck does everyone hate syria so much ? .,why does everyone hate syria so much ?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'why the fuck' is appropriately replaced with the neutral 'why', effectively removing the profanity while maintaining the original question's intent.

This represents a successful detoxification with no loss in meaning or quality."
yeh well ban me fukkers fuck you morons,yeh well ban me,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes all toxic content, replacing highly offensive language ('fukkers', 'fuck you morons') with a clean, neutral expression, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the core meaning is partially lost—the original expresses strong anger and defiance toward perceived idiots, while the neutral version 'yeh well ban me' only retains the idea of being banned but omits the emotional and interpersonal critique. Despite the meaning reduction, the output is grammatically correct and fluent, with natural informal tone matching the original style."
you have got to be insane .,You have to be insane,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text does not fully remove the toxic content; while it slightly rephrases 'you have got to be insane' to 'You have to be insane', the core expression 'insane' remains, which is a strong, potentially offensive judgment. Thus, only partial detoxification is achieved (STA = 0.5). However, the core meaning is fully preserved (CS = 1.0), and the rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent (FS = 1.0). The joint score is the average of the three: (0.5 + 1.0 + 1.0) / 3 = 0.83."

If you want you can find sources for every shit.","Goths listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop If you want you can find sources for every thing",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the vulgar term 'shit' and replaces it with the more neutral 'thing', achieving complete detoxification, so STA is 1.0. The core meaning of the original sentence is preserved—both parts about Goths' music preferences and the availability of sources—so CS is 1.0. However, the neutral text has a fluency issue: the period after 'baby pop' is missing, resulting in a run-on sentence ('baby pop If you want...'), which affects readability. This minor but noticeable grammatical error justifies a FS score of 0.5."

Therefore, no detoxification has been performed, resulting in a Style Transfer Accuracy score of 0.0. The original meaning is fully preserved, earning a Content Similarity score of 1.0. The text is grammatically correct and readable, so Fluency is scored 1.0."

"I will do Whatever i want and it is my right, what is both of yous Problem Asshole.","I will do whatever I want and it is my right, what is both of yous problem",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the offensive term 'Asshole', making the language neutral and thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. The core meaning—that the speaker asserts their right to do what they want and questions the others' issue—is fully preserved, so content similarity is high. However, the phrase 'both of yous problem' contains a grammatical error ('yous' instead of 'you' or 'your'), which affects fluency.

WTF How The Fuck Does This Person Merit A Page On Wikipedia.,How does this person merit a page on Wikipedia,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text uses strong vulgar expressions 'WTF' and 'How The Fuck', which are effectively removed in the neutral text by omitting these expletives while retaining the core interrogative structure and meaning. The neutral version 'How does this person merit a page on Wikipedia' is a grammatically correct, fluent, and natural rephrasing that conveys the same skepticism without any offensive language. All toxic elements are eliminated, the original meaning is fully preserved, and the language is clear and readable."

The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with no language errors, so fluency is fully preserved."
I drive a Subaru Legacy and I'm a conservative But I still think you're an idiot.,I drive a Subaru Legacy and I'm a conservative But I still think you're wrong,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic term 'idiot' and replaces it with the more neutral 'wrong,' resulting in completely non-toxic, neutral language (STA: 1.0). The fluency is excellent, with no grammatical or structural issues, making the sentence natural and readable (FS: 1.0). However, while the general sentiment of disagreement is preserved, the original meaning includes a personal insult ('idiot') that conveys strong disapproval of the person, whereas 'wrong' only addresses the correctness of the person's opinion. This shifts the focus from a personal attack to a disagreement with ideas, leading to partial preservation of meaning (CS: 0.5)."
"Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be an arse hole","Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be unsuitable",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The term 'arse hole' is a clear insult and has been successfully replaced with 'unsuitable', which is neutral and non-offensive, achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, while the general negative sentiment is preserved, the specific characterization of the person's behavior as offensive or obnoxious is weakened—'unsuitable' is vaguer and less personally critical, leading to partial loss of the original meaning. The neutral text is grammatically correct and fluent, with no issues in readability or expression."
"You're not an admin, so shut the fuck up faggot.","You're not an admin, so shut up",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text removes the explicit vulgar phrase 'the fuck' and the highly offensive slur 'faggot', which improves politeness. However, the core imperative command 'shut up' remains, which retains a confrontational and impolite tone, thus only partially achieving style transfer to a neutral style. Therefore, STA is scored 0.5. The content similarity is high as the rewritten sentence preserves the original intent and meaning that the person is not an admin and should stop speaking. Fluency is unaffected and the sentence is grammatically correct and natural, so FS is 1.0."
"Yes, the wikipedia page, like I just mentioned, dumbass.","Yes, the wikipedia page, like I just mentioned",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the offensive term 'dumbass', resulting in completely neutral language, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy.

You amins are such bastards.,You amins are so bad,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"The original toxic term 'bastards' is replaced with 'so bad', which softens the language but does not fully achieve a neutral tone—'so bad' still carries a negative and vague judgment without specifying the behavior, thus only partially removing the toxicity. The core meaning regarding disapproval of 'amins' is preserved, so content similarity is high. The neutral text is grammatically correct and fluent, with natural expression. However, the detoxification is incomplete, as the replacement lacks precision and remains somewhat pejorative."
"Quit Defacing my user page, you ugly cunt.-",Quit Defacing my user page,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the offensive insult 'you ugly cunt' and converts the statement into a neutral request, achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the removal of the second part of the sentence results in a partial loss of the original emphasis and interpersonal context, leading to a moderate reduction in content similarity. The output is grammatically correct and fluent, with no language errors."

Randi was born a DICK.,Randi was born a bad person,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The original toxic text uses the word 'DICK' as a derogatory insult, which has been successfully replaced with the neutral term 'bad person', effectively removing the offensive language and achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the original phrase 'born a DICK' carries a strong connotation of inherent contempt or vulgarity, while 'born a bad person' generalizes the meaning and loses some of the original nuance—particularly the intensity and idiomatic usage—resulting in partial content preservation. The neutral text is grammatically correct and fluent, with no issues in readability or expression. Thus, content similarity is scored 0.5 due to meaning generalization, while fluency and style transfer accuracy are fully achieved."
This is your last warning; stop being an asshole.,This is your last warning; stop being bad,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the offensive term 'asshole' and replaces it with the milder 'bad', making the language neutral and appropriate, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the replacement slightly weakens the original intensity and specificity of the criticism—'asshole' implies not just bad behavior but a disrespectful or rude attitude, which is not fully preserved in the more general term 'bad', leading to partial meaning loss. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with no language errors. Overall, the detoxification is effective but involves a slight compromise in meaning precision."
"MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize, so fuck you.","MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize, so you",0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"The neutral text attempts to remove the profanity 'fuck you' by replacing it with 'you', but this leaves the sentence grammatically incomplete and abrupt, thus only partially removing the toxic expression. The core meaning of asserting freedom of speech on the user page and denying vandalism is fully preserved, so content similarity is high. However, the resulting sentence 'so you' is syntactically incorrect and disrupts fluency, making the text less readable despite being mostly understandable in context. Therefore, fluency is compromised."

"Heh, look, not EVERYTHING is on google. you are a dumbass.","Heh, look, not EVERYTHING is on google you are wrong",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the offensive term 'dumbass' and replaces the statement with 'you are wrong', which is significantly less toxic and maintains a neutral tone, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the original insult carries a stronger connotation of stupidity or incompetence, while 'you are wrong' only addresses factual inaccuracy, leading to a partial loss of the original meaning's intensity and nuance. Therefore, content similarity is scored as 0.5. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, though the lack of punctuation between 'google' and 'you' slightly affects readability but does not impede understanding, so fluency remains high."
Thanks for being an ass when I tried to help.,Thanks for being ungrateful when I tried to help,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'an ass' and replaces it with the more neutral and respectful term 'ungrateful', achieving complete style transfer to a non-offensive tone. However, while the general sentiment of disappointment is preserved, the specific characterization of the person's behavior shifts from rudeness (being an ass) to a lack of gratitude, which slightly alters the original meaning. Thus, content similarity is partially preserved but not fully aligned with the original intent. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with natural language flow."
"You're a fucking moron, go read the notability guidelines.","You're not smart, go read the notability guidelines",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the profanity 'fucking moron' and replaces it with the milder 'not smart', making the language neutral and non-insulting, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the original intensity and emotional charge of calling someone a 'moron' is significantly weakened in 'not smart', which leads to a partial loss of the original meaning's emphasis, resulting in a content similarity score of 0.5. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fully fluent, with no issues in readability or expression, warranting a fluency score of 1.0."
Some bubble tea for you! thanks ass hole,Some bubble tea for you! thanks,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'ass hole' and replaces it with a clean ending, achieving complete style transfer to a neutral tone. However, the original text includes an ironic or sarcastic tone conveyed by 'thanks ass hole', which is lost in the neutral version—this results in partial meaning preservation, as the gratitude is now ambiguous or overly polite rather than clearly sarcastic. Despite this, the core action (giving bubble tea) and surface-level thanks are retained. The neutral text is grammatically correct and fluent, with no language issues."

The core idea—that people were deceived by someone's tricks—is preserved, but the characterization of the group as 'dumb' is softened, leading to a partial loss of the original evaluative meaning (CS: 0.5). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with no issues in readability or expression (FS: 1.0)."
These people are INSANE.,These people are not normal,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the emotionally charged and exaggerated term 'INSANE' and replaces it with the more neutral 'not normal', achieving complete detoxification. Thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0. However, 'not normal' is a softer and less intense expression than 'INSANE', which slightly alters the original emphasis and intensity, leading to partial preservation of meaning—hence Content Similarity is 0.5. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and clear, so Fluency is 1.0. The joint score is the average of the three: (1.0 + 0.5 + 1.0) / 3 = 0.83."
Did you know that you are an ugly piece of shit?,Did you know that you are not good?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the highly offensive and toxic expression 'ugly piece of shit' by replacing it with the milder 'not good', resulting in a completely neutral tone (STA: 1.0). However, this simplification significantly weakens the original intensity and specificity of the insult, leading to partial loss of the original meaning—while the negative evaluation is preserved, the severity and emotional weight are diminished (CS: 0.5). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, with no language errors (FS: 1.0)."
Be careful who you call a moron.,Be careful who you call a bad person,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the offensive term 'moron' and replaces it with the more neutral 'bad person', achieving complete style transfer to a non-toxic form. However, the original term 'moron' implies foolishness or lack of intelligence, whereas 'bad person' suggests moral deficiency, which shifts the meaning somewhat. Thus, while the core cautionary message is preserved, the characterization is altered, leading to partial content similarity. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with natural language flow."
"Yeah, you can fuck off incel.","Yeah, you can go away incel",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text partially removes toxic content by replacing the profanity 'fuck off' with the milder 'go away', which reduces the hostility. However, the term 'incel' is retained without modification, which can still carry derogatory and stigmatizing connotations depending on context, thus limiting the extent of style transfer. The core meaning is fully preserved, as the intent to dismiss or reject the person remains intact. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with natural expression. Therefore, STA is scored 0.5 due to incomplete neutralization of potentially toxic terminology, while CS and FS receive full scores."
"Stop defending pedophiles, faggot.",Stop defending pedophiles,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic term 'faggot', which is a highly offensive slur, resulting in a completely neutral tone; thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0. However, the original sentence contains two distinct components: condemning the defense of pedophiles and insulting the addressee. The neutral version retains only the first part, omitting the interpersonal attack but also losing the emphasis on the addressee's role or stance, leading to partial meaning preservation (CS = 0.5). The output is grammatically correct and clear, so Fluency is 1.0. The joint score is the average: (1.0 + 0.5 + 1.0) / 3 = 0.83."
"No one is vandalizing assholes, so get it straight!!!","No one is vandalizing people, so get it straight!!!",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The toxic term 'assholes' has been successfully replaced with the neutral 'people', effectively removing the offensive language and achieving full style transfer accuracy. The fluency of the neutral text is excellent, with no grammatical or structural issues. However, the content similarity is partially reduced because 'assholes' carries a strong evaluative connotation (disapproval or contempt) that is completely lost in 'people', which is neutral and generic. This weakens the original emphasis or attitude, resulting in some loss of the speaker's intended meaning or emotional nuance."
"DUDE CALM THE FUCK DOWN!!!
",Dude calm down!!!,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'CALM THE FUCK DOWN' is successfully rewritten as 'calm down', which removes the profanity while preserving the imperative tone and core meaning.

Therefore, toxic content is partially reduced but not fully eliminated, warranting a 0.5 for Style Transfer Accuracy. The core meaning is fully preserved—both the factual issue (inability to verify due to deleted MySpace account) and the emotional expression are retained—so Content Similarity is 1.0. The language is grammatically correct and readable, with no fluency issues, resulting in a Fluency score of 1.0."
He deserves every beating and rape he will be subjected to.,He deserves every beating and rape he will be subjected to,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text fails to remove highly toxic content, as it retains explicit wishes for violence and sexual assault ('every beating and rape'), which are severe violations of ethical and safety norms. Therefore, Style Transfer Accuracy is 0.0. The content similarity is 1.0 because the meaning is preserved exactly, with only a period missing in the neutral version, which does not affect core information. Fluency is 1.0 as the sentence is grammatically correct and fully readable. However, the lack of any detoxification renders the output unacceptable as a neutralized version."
