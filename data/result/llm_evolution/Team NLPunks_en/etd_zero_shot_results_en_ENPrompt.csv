any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,any of us who did half this would be held accountable already.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All profanity (""shit"", ""the fuck"") and the violent tone (""locked ... up"") have been replaced with neutral language (""held accountable""). The transformed sentence is completely non-toxic, so STA = 1.
CS: The core idea—‘if any of us had done even half of these actions, we would already be facing serious consequences’—is fully retained. While “locked up” is rendered as “held accountable,” it still conveys punishment for wrongdoing, preserving the main meaning. Hence CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical and easy to read; no spelling or structural issues are present. Therefore FS = 1."
are they liars or just clueless ?,are they uninformed or just unaware?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic elements ""liars"" and ""clueless"" (insults/negative judgment) are replaced with neutral terms ""uninformed"" and ""unaware,"" fully removing the toxic tone, so STA = 1.
CS: The original contrasts deliberate dishonesty (""liars"") with ignorance (""clueless""). The neutral version contrasts two forms of ignorance (""uninformed"" vs. ""unaware""), dropping the idea of intentional deception. Core topic (questioning the reason behind someone's statements) remains, but an important semantic distinction is lost, so CS = 0.5.
FS: The sentence is grammatical, clear, and natural: ""Are they uninformed or just unaware?"" Therefore FS = 1."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .","as someone from la and an oilfield worker, i still say this person is not impressive.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The phrase “piece of shit” (clearly toxic) has been replaced by the neutral phrase “not impressive,” eliminating any profanity or hateful language, so a full score (1) is appropriate.
CS: Both sentences express a negative judgment about the same individual and maintain the speaker’s identity (“as someone from LA and an oilfield worker”). However, the intensity shifts from a strong moral condemnation (“piece of shit”) to a milder critique (“not impressive”). Because the core sentiment (negative opinion) is preserved but its strength changes, some meaning is lost, warranting a partial score (0.5).
FS: The neutral sentence is clear and grammatical; word order, punctuation, and vocabulary are correct. The only minor issue is the lowercase “i,” which does not significantly hinder readability. Overall fluency is high, so a full score (1) is assigned."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","calm down, cnn.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral text removes the explicit swear word ""fuck,"" eliminating all toxic content and resulting in a fully neutral sentence, so a score of 1 is warranted.
CS: Aside from deleting the profanity, the directive (telling CNN to calm down) is fully preserved; no core information is lost, thus CS = 1.
FS: ""calm down, cnn."" is short, grammatical, and perfectly readable. Capitalization of ""cnn"" is optional stylistic choice and does not impair fluency, so FS = 1."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,China and Russia will use diplomatic pressure to address any concerns if those ships take any provocative actions.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The violent, threatening wording ('use a big stick to smack Trump around') has been entirely replaced by neutral phrasing ('use diplomatic pressure'). No toxic or insulting language remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The central idea that China and Russia will react if the ships act provocatively is kept. However, the nature of the reaction is altered from physical force to diplomatic pressure, which changes an important aspect of the original meaning. Therefore only partial preservation: CS = 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is well-formed, grammatical and easy to read; capitalization and punctuation are correct. Hence FS = 1.
Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,cretins rarely care about facts.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The toxic slur ""cretins"" is still present in the rewritten sentence, so the toxic content has not been removed at all → 0. CS: Apart from dropping the minor phrase ""like this,"" the sentence still conveys exactly the same meaning (that people called ""cretins"" rarely care about facts) → 1. FS: The neutral sentence ""cretins rarely care about facts."" is short, grammatical, and perfectly readable → 1. Joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,do people actually believe this??,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""shit"" has been removed and no other offensive language remains; the sentence is now neutral, so STA = 1. CS: The neutral sentence still asks exactly the same question about whether people believe something, so the core meaning is fully preserved, giving CS = 1. FS: The sentence is short, grammatically correct, and easily understandable; the double question mark is acceptable informal punctuation and does not harm readability, therefore FS = 1."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","Don't you ever change one of my edits, or I will be very upset.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The violent threat ""I will come to your house and cut you"" is completely removed and replaced with a non-toxic statement of displeasure. No offensive or violent language remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The central idea that the speaker warns the listener not to change an edit and mentions a negative consequence is retained. However, the specific information that the consequence is a physical threat is lost, altering the intensity and nature of the original message. Therefore only partial meaning is preserved → CS = 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is well-formed, grammatically correct, and easily readable: ""Don't you ever change one of my edits, or I will be very upset."" No errors or awkward phrasing, so FS = 1."
even bush knows he fucked up .,even bush knows he made a mistake.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive phrase “fucked up” has been fully replaced with the neutral expression “made a mistake,” eliminating all toxic language, so the style transfer accuracy is perfect.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the subject (Bush) and the meaning—acknowledging that Bush recognizes an error—unchanged. No core information is lost, so content similarity is fully preserved.
FS: The sentence ""even bush knows he made a mistake"" is short, clear, and grammatically correct. Although proper capitalization could improve style, it doesn’t hinder readability or grammar, thus fluency is judged perfect.
Overall, all three dimensions score 1, giving a joint score of 1.0."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,Popeyes for doing this in the first place.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The offensive word “fuck” has been completely removed and no other toxic expression remains, so style transfer accuracy is perfect.

CS: The original sentence conveyed a negative, condemnatory attitude toward Popeyes. In the neutral text, the reference to Popeyes and ‘doing this in the first place’ is still present, but the negative judgment is lost and the sentence is now merely a fragment without clear stance. Hence only part of the original meaning is preserved, warranting 0.5.

FS: The neutral output is understandable but it is a sentence fragment lacking a main verb (“Popeyes for doing this in the first place”). This grammatical incompleteness reduces fluency, so it receives 0.5."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,getting my ass kicked by practice tests made sure that I learned from my mistakes again.,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.0,"STA: The neutral sentence still contains the profanity 'my ass kicked'. Therefore the toxic element has not been removed at all, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 0.

CS: The main idea (doing practice tests leads to not repeating mistakes) is kept, but one piece of information – that the tests are GRE practice tests – is lost, and the wording shifts from ‘never make this same mistake again’ to ‘learned from my mistakes again’, which slightly changes the nuance. Hence partial preservation → 0.5.

FS: The sentence is understandable, but there are minor fluency issues: it begins with a lowercase letter, and the construction ‘made sure that I learned from my mistakes again’ is a bit awkward. Still, it is readable without serious grammatical breakdowns, so 0.5.

Average of the three subscores = (0 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.33."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,getting stronger every month yeah I wish.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element, the expletive 'fucking', has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence → 1.
CS: Aside from removing the swear word, all words and the overall meaning ('I wish I were getting stronger every month') are intact → 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but not fully well-formed: it starts with a lowercase letter, lacks commas, and reads as a fragment ('getting stronger every month yeah I wish'). These minor grammatical/punctuation issues reduce fluency → 0.5."
have you ever been to r trees and seen all the shit people say weed can do ? .,have you ever been to r trees and seen all the misinformation about weed?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""shit"" has been completely removed and replaced with neutral wording; no offensive language remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The sentence still conveys the same idea—asking if someone has visited r/trees and noticed exaggerated/false claims about weed. Replacing ""all the shit people say weed can do"" with ""all the misinformation about weed"" keeps the core meaning intact, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and reads naturally (""have you ever been to r trees and seen all the misinformation about weed?""); therefore, FS = 1.
Overall, the average (joint) score is (1 + 1 + 1)/3 = 1.0."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .","holy shit, a cop got let go?.",0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The toxic exclamation ""holy shit"" (profane word ""shit"") remains unchanged, so no toxic content has been removed. According to the rubric this yields 0.
CS: Aside from replacing ""fired"" with the near-synonym ""let go"", the sentence conveys exactly the same information: surprise that a police officer lost their job. Core meaning is fully preserved, so CS = 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable but has a punctuation error (""? ."" double ending) and is slightly awkward (""a cop got let go"" is informal but acceptable). These minor issues justify a 0.5 for fluency.
Joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (0 + 1 + 0.5)/3 = 0.5."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,how do you manage that?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic phrase ""the fuck"" has been completely removed, yielding a neutral sentence, so the style transfer accuracy is 1.
CS: Aside from removing the profanity, the rewritten sentence keeps the original question and intent exactly the same—asking how someone manages something—so content similarity is fully preserved, earning a 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatically correct, properly punctuated, and fully fluent, so fluency is 1."
how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,how do you think people afford houses and cars?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic expletive ""fuck"" has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so the style transfer accuracy is 1.
CS: Aside from deleting the expletive, every word and the full meaning of the question remain intact, so content similarity is fully preserved at 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and fluent (the lack of initial capitalization after a lower-case start is acceptable in casual text), so fluency is 1."
i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,I accidentally read the title as laser machete and almost had a shock.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive phrase “shit my pants” has been fully replaced with the neutral expression “had a shock.” No profanity or toxicity remains, so the style transfer is fully successful.
CS: All key information is retained: the speaker misread the title as “laser machete” and had a strong reaction. The change from a vulgar expression of surprise to a neutral one does not alter the core meaning, so content preservation is complete.
FS: The sentence is grammatical and easily readable. ""Had a shock"" is slightly less common than ""got a shock,"" but it is still standard English and poses no comprehension issues. Therefore, fluency is fully acceptable."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,I did not vandalize anything.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral text has completely removed the toxic insult ""you dick,"" resulting in a fully neutral sentence, so the score is 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the insult, the sentence still conveys exactly the same factual content—denial of vandalism—so core meaning is fully preserved, earning a 1.
FS: ""I did not vandalize anything."" is a perfectly grammatical, natural-sounding English sentence with no errors, so Fluency is 1."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,I don't care about sides!,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy: The offensive phrase “flying fuck” has been completely removed and replaced with neutral wording, leaving no toxic or profane content, so STA = 1.
Content Similarity: Both sentences express the identical idea – the speaker does not care about sides. No core information is lost or altered, so CS = 1.
Fluency: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, well-punctuated, and entirely natural in English, so FS = 1."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,I have toilet paper to wipe my bottom and no shortage of food.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The original profanity ""ass"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""bottom,"" eliminating the toxic slang entirely, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1. 
CS: Every element of meaning (having toilet paper, its intended use, and no shortage of food) is fully preserved; therefore Content Similarity is 1. 
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, properly capitalized, and perfectly readable; no awkward phrasing or errors are present, so Fluency is 1."
i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but fucking seriously .,"I mean it's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff, but seriously.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the expletive 'fucking'. It has been removed, and no other offensive language appears, so the sentence is fully neutral → 1.
CS: Aside from deleting the expletive, all words and structure remain intact. The statement still conveys that the speaker thinks the pope is awesome and cool, but is expressing earnestness/amazement ('seriously'). No semantic content is lost → 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, capitalizes the first word, and uses proper punctuation. It reads smoothly without errors → 1."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","i sell quite a bit of products on there, and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence replaces the offensive word ""shit"" with the neutral word ""products"", fully removing the toxic element; no other offensive language remains, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from the substitution of a slang noun with its neutral equivalent, all information (selling items on a platform and PayPal helping to pay the bills) is retained, so the core meaning is completely preserved, CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but has minor fluency issues: the pronoun ""i"" is not capitalized and the phrase ""quite a bit of products"" is slightly ungrammatical (standard usage would be ""quite a lot of products"" or ""quite a few products""). These minor errors lower readability somewhat, so FS = 0.5.
Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
"if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the shit out of him .","if he's found to have acted in cold blood, the authorities will take severe action against him.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral text removes the profanity ""the shit out of"" and replaces the slang ""feds"" with the neutral term ""authorities,"" eliminating all toxic or aggressive wording, so it deserves 1. CS: The neutral sentence still states that if he is found to have acted in cold blood, the relevant authorities will impose severe consequences. This fully preserves the core meaning of the original statement (strong legal action following wrongdoing), so the score is 1. FS: The sentence is grammatically correct, properly punctuated, and fully understandable with no awkward phrasing, warranting a fluency score of 1."
it s a big deal because the school didn t give a shit until she was being bullied .,it's a big deal because the school didn't take action until she was being bullied.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic phrase ""give a shit"" was replaced with the neutral phrase ""take action,"" removing all profanity and toxicity, so STA = 1. CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the full meaning—the school did nothing until she was bullied—so CS = 1. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, well-punctuated, and easily understood, so FS = 1."
"judging by the shit i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .","judging by the experiences I've had in my number years, number of those spent with George W.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy: The offensive word ""shit"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""experiences,"" and no new toxic language was introduced, so STA = 1.
Content Similarity: Apart from substituting the vulgar term, the sentence keeps the same structure and conveys the same idea (judging by what the speaker has seen/experienced over a certain number of years with George W.), so CS = 1.
Fluency: The sentence is mostly readable, but phrases like ""my number years"" and the duplicated use of ""number"" are awkward and grammatically off. This causes minor fluency issues while still being understandable, so FS = 0.5."
"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up","last warning, it takes minutes to resolve a page so it's important to work together.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: All profanity and direct insults (""fucking"", ""tosser"", ""cunts"", ""fuck … up"") are completely removed, and the remaining wording is neutral. Therefore, Style Transfer Accuracy = 1. 
CS: The main idea that a page can be resolved quickly is preserved, but the original accusatory meaning (that the addressee is vandalising Wikipedia and the speaker can undo it) is shifted to a cooperative message (""it's important to work together""). Because part of the intent is changed and some information is lost, Content Similarity = 0.5. 
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and easily understandable; no noticeable errors. Hence Fluency = 1. 
Joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .","liar, liar pants on fire",0.0,0.5,1.0,0.0,"STA: The neutral text still contains the repeated insult ""liar""; therefore no meaningful detoxification has occurred. 
CS: The neutral text keeps the core accusation of dishonesty (""liar, liar pants on fire"") but drops the addressee ""Justin,"" losing part of the original information, so only partial preservation. 
FS: The phrase is a well-known, grammatically correct expression and is fully readable, so fluency is high."
my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,my thoughts are that our new guy might be a disappointment.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The insult 'dirt bag' was replaced by the neutral term 'disappointment'; no other toxic wording remains, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1). CS: Both sentences convey a negative expectation about the new person, but nuances are lost: the comparative phrase 'even bigger' and the specific moral insult 'dirt bag' (implying bad character) are softened to a general performance judgment 'disappointment.' Some meaning is preserved but with noticeable semantic shift, warranting a partial score (0.5). FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and perfectly readable; no fluency issues observed (score 1)."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","no way, number bricks don't fit in a car, this is unbelievable.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The explicit profanities ""fucking"" and the shorthand ""bs"" have been removed and replaced with neutral wording (""no way"", ""unbelievable""). No remaining toxic terms are present, so the style transfer is fully successful → 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence still expresses disbelief that a certain number of bricks can fit into a car. The core propositions (bricks + car + disbelief) are intact. Only lexical changes were made to soften tone; no factual content was lost → 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it has several minor fluency problems: lack of initial capitalization, comma-splice structure, and the odd noun phrase ""number bricks"" which feels ungrammatical (should be ""the number of bricks"" or similar). Because of these noticeable but non-blocking issues, fluency is judged as adequate but not perfect → 0.5."
noones asking you to invade shit .,noones asking you to invade anything.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic word “shit” has been replaced with the neutral word “anything,” so all toxic language is removed (score 1).
CS: The sentence still conveys exactly the same idea—nobody is asking the listener to invade—so the core meaning is fully preserved (score 1).
FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable, but it contains the misspelling/grammatical error “noones” instead of “no one’s” and lacks standard capitalization; these minor issues affect fluency, so fluency is rated 0.5."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,not getting involved in foreign matters that we cannot influence.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The obscene word ""fucking"" is removed and no other toxic or aggressive language appears, so the transformed sentence is completely neutral. 
CS: The neutral sentence conveys exactly the same idea—avoiding involvement in foreign matters that are beyond our power/influence—without adding or omitting essential information. Hence, meaning is fully preserved. 
FS: The sentence is clear, grammatical, and easy to read. Although it starts with a lowercase letter, this is a negligible stylistic issue that does not affect fluency, so it is considered fully fluent."
nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady as fuck .,nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look suspicious.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity ""as fuck"" is fully removed and replaced with neutral wording; no hateful or profane language remains, so toxic content is eliminated (score 1). CS: The new sentence keeps all factual information: the presence of only missing footage will make the events during the unaccounted-for period appear questionable. Replacing ""shady as fuck"" with ""suspicious"" conveys the same core meaning, so no information is lost (score 1). FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, coherent, and easily readable. Aside from minor stylistic choices (no initial capitalization), there are no errors that hinder comprehension, meeting the criteria for full fluency (score 1)."
number will solve alot of fucking problems if it comes down to it .,number will solve a lot of problems if it comes down to it.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the expletive ""fucking"". It is completely removed in the neutral version, leaving no offensive or aggressive language, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from removing the swear word, all other words and structure are retained (including the conditional clause ""if it comes down to it""). Therefore the core meaning—claiming that a certain number will solve many problems—remains intact. CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable and free of major grammatical errors, but the lack of a determiner before ""number"" makes it sound slightly awkward/unidiomatic (""The number"" or ""That number"" would be more natural). Because of this minor fluency issue, FS = 0.5 rather than 1.
Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random shit like this .,there are Wikipedia articles for all sorts of random things like this.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""shit"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""things,"" eliminating the offensive language entirely, so the style transfer is fully successful.
CS: Aside from the substitution of the single word, all information (existence of many Wikipedia articles on random topics) is preserved. Core meaning is unchanged, so full score.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, capitalizes Wikipedia properly, and reads naturally. No errors detected, hence full fluency.
Overall, all three dimensions achieve perfect performance, yielding a joint score of 1.0."
"ouch man , them swedes were dicks to norway =\","ouch man, them Swedes were unfair to Norway =\",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive term ""dicks"" is replaced with the neutral word ""unfair,"" removing all toxic language, so full credit (1).
CS: Aside from the adjective change, the proposition that Swedes treated Norway poorly is preserved, as are the interjections and emoticon; core meaning is unchanged, so full credit (1).
FS: The output is understandable and nearly fluent, but the phrase ""them Swedes"" is non-standard grammar, preventing a perfect fluency score; minor punctuation is also informal (""=\""). Hence 0.5.
Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
people are idiots for wasting emergency call time on crap like this .,people are wasting emergency call time on unnecessary issues.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic words ""idiots"" and ""crap"" have been completely removed; no pejorative or offensive language remains, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: The core idea—that people waste emergency call time on trivial/unnecessary matters—is fully retained. The evaluative insult is dropped but that does not alter the factual content, so Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and easy to read. Aside from the initial lowercase 'p', there are no fluency problems, so Fluency is 1."
"quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some idiot hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .","quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some authority figure, even unto being killed, like St.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the insult 'idiot'. It has been replaced by the neutral phrase 'authority figure'. No other derogatory language remains, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from substituting the insulting adjective, all propositional content is intact: a number of saints were canonized for opposing a church leader/authority and were killed for it. The substitution of 'hierarch' with 'authority figure' does not change the core meaning. Therefore CS = 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is mostly grammatical, but it ends with the fragment 'like St.' which feels incomplete (it should specify a saint’s name or omit the phrase). This minor flaw affects naturalness, so FS = 0.5.
Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
read your own fucking link .,read your own link.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""fucking"" has been completely removed, leaving no offensive language, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the slur, the sentence still instructs the reader to consult their own link, fully preserving the original meaning; thus Content Similarity is 1.
FS: ""Read your own link."" is short, grammatical, and perfectly understandable, so Fluency is 1.
Overall, all three dimensions score 1, giving a joint score of 1.0."
same crap going on in the pnw too .,same issues going on in the PNW too.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The word ""crap"" carries a clearly negative, mildly profane tone. It has been replaced by the neutral word ""issues,"" eliminating the toxic element, so STA = 1.
CS: Aside from the substitution of a synonym, the sentence keeps the same information: something undesirable is happening in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). No content was added or lost, so CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable and grammatically sound, but it begins with a lowercase ""same,"" which is a minor capitalization error at the start of a sentence. Because the criteria for a perfect 1.0 require no grammatical issues, this small error lowers fluency to 0.5.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
"shit , i d love an number pm sunset .",I'd love a number pm sunset.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the expletive “shit”. It has been entirely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the expletive, the rewritten sentence keeps the rest of the content (“I’d love a number pm sunset”) essentially unchanged, so the core meaning is preserved. Therefore CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is readable, but the phrase ""a number pm sunset"" is awkward and lacks clear structure or punctuation, making it less than fully fluent. Because of this minor but noticeable fluency issue, FS = 0.5.
Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped in the ass .,some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The overtly toxic fragment ""to get raped in the ass"" has been fully removed, and no new toxic wording appears, so style transfer accuracy is perfect (1).
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the essential facts (a man robs a liquor store for $400 and is sent to prison) but omits the additional information that the speaker expects him to be raped in prison. Because some semantic content is lost—even though it is toxic—only partial meaning is preserved, so content similarity is 0.5.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, clear, and easy to read. The only very minor issue is the lack of initial capitalization, which does not impede comprehension, so fluency is rated 1.
Overall joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
"someone says no , and they say fuck off we need vets only for free housing ? .","someone says no, and they say we need vets only for free housing?",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the expletive “fuck off.” This has been completely removed, and no other toxic language remains, so the style transfer is fully successful (score 1).
CS: Apart from dropping the offensive phrase, the rewritten sentence keeps all informational content: someone said “no,” and another party responds that housing should be reserved for veterans. Removing the swear word does not change the core factual meaning, so content preservation is complete (score 1).
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but still awkward: it lacks initial capitalization and contains an odd coordination (""someone says no, and they say we need vets only for free housing?""). The structure feels fragmented and slightly confusing, though not unintelligible. Minor grammatical/clarity issues justify a partial fluency score (0.5).
Overall joint score is the arithmetic mean: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,still standing up for your leader who loves themselves and others.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the toxic epithets “lying” and “crazy” and the hostile claim that the leader loves nobody else. No hostile or insulting language remains, so STA = 1.

CS: The clause about supporting a leader is preserved, but two meaningful attributes change: (1) the leader is no longer described as lying/crazy, and (2) the love-only-himself notion is flipped to loving others. These are important pieces of semantic information, so only partial meaning is retained. Hence CS = 0.5.

FS: The neutral text is grammatically correct, coherent, and easy to read. The only minor issue is the lack of initial capitalization, but this does not hinder comprehension. Therefore FS = 1.

Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
sucked like nothings ever sucked before .,was extremely disappointing.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic term “sucked” is replaced with the neutral phrasing “was extremely disappointing,” removing the vulgar/toxic tone completely, so STA = 1.
CS: Both sentences convey the same core meaning—that something was very bad. No information is lost (both lack an explicit subject, so parity is maintained), so CS = 1.
FS: The rewritten text is understandable and well-worded, but it is a sentence fragment because it lacks an explicit subject (it opens with the verb ""was""). This grammatical issue lowers fluency to 0.5 rather than 1. Overall, the text is still clear, hence FS = 0.5."
taking a stand with either party is equally retarded .,taking a stand with either party is equally misguided.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive slur ""retarded"" has been replaced with the neutral adjective ""misguided,"" fully removing toxic content, so STA = 1.
CS: The sentence still states that supporting either party is equally ill-advised; no core information is lost, thus CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, hence FS = 1.
Overall, all three dimensions receive the maximum score, giving an average joint score of 1.0."
that almost never happens excepts rarely in shit hole countries .,that almost never happens except in rare cases.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic expression ""shit hole countries"" has been completely removed and no other offensive language is present, so full credit (1).
CS: The main idea that the event almost never happens is kept, but the original specifies that the rare occurrences are confined to certain (derogatorily described) countries, whereas the neutral version just says ""rare cases."" The locational detail is lost, so only partial preservation (0.5).
FS: The neutral sentence is clear, grammatical and natural-sounding: ""that almost never happens except in rare cases."" No errors impede understanding, so full fluency (1)."
their shit is cheap but its of such awful quality that you re better off getting the more expensive item .,"their product is not worth the price, it's better to invest in a higher-quality item.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""shit"" is replaced with the neutral term ""product"" and all offensive language is removed, yielding fully neutral wording, so STA = 1.
CS: The revised sentence still conveys that the item offered by the seller is poor value/quality and that the customer should opt for a higher-quality (more expensive) alternative. No essential information is lost, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is clear, grammatical, and natural: ""their product is not worth the price, it's better to invest in a higher-quality item."" There are no fluency problems, so FS = 1."
they need stop tratening people like morons .,they need to stop treating people disrespectfully.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""morons"" has been replaced by the neutral phrase ""disrespectfully,"" removing the derogatory content entirely. Therefore, style transfer accuracy is perfect.
CS: The source sentence asks that ""they need (to) stop treating people like morons,"" which semantically means not treating people with disrespect. The neutral sentence, ""they need to stop treating people disrespectfully,"" conveys the same core request with no loss of meaning, so content similarity is fully preserved.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding English. No errors or awkward phrasing are present, giving it full fluency.
Overall, all three dimensions score 1, yielding a joint score of 1.0."
they re both fucked up .,they are both flawed.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive phrase ""fucked up"" has been replaced with the neutral adjective ""flawed,"" fully removing toxicity, so the style transfer accuracy is 1. CS: ""Flawed"" conveys essentially the same idea as ""fucked up"" in this context (both indicate that the two subjects have problems), and no other information is lost, so content similarity is 1. FS: The sentence ""they are both flawed."" is short, grammatical, and natural-sounding; therefore fluency is 1."
this guy is a total sellout with no brains for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking .,this guy lacks the ability for forward thinking.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic elements ('total sellout', 'no brains for business') containing direct insults are fully removed. What remains is a mildly negative but non-toxic statement, so the text is now neutral → 1.
CS: The original conveys three criticisms: (1) he is a sellout, (2) he has no business sense, and (3) he lacks forward-thinking ability. The neutral sentence retains only point (3), dropping the other two pieces of meaning. Thus, about half of the core information is lost → 0.5.
FS: The sentence ""this guy lacks the ability for forward thinking."" is clear, grammatical, and easily readable. Minor stylistic alternatives exist (e.g., ""to think ahead""), but no serious issues → 1."
"this is a joke , are you all fucking retards ? .","this is a joke, are you all confused?.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic phrase ""fucking retards"" is completely replaced with the neutral word ""confused"", removing both profanity and slur; therefore, toxic content is fully eliminated (score 1).
CS: The sentence still states that the utterance is a joke and questions the audience’s understanding, so the core idea is preserved. The loss of the insulting tone does not count against content similarity because only semantic information (that the audience doesn’t get the joke) matters; hence full preservation (score 1).
FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable but contains a punctuation error (""? ."") and a slight spacing issue. These minor mistakes reduce smoothness though they do not hinder comprehension, warranting a partial score (0.5).
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
this is some twilight zone shit,this is some weird shit,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA): The original toxicity comes from the profanity ""shit."" The neutral text retains exactly the same profane word, so no toxic language has been removed. Therefore STA = 0.

Content Similarity (CS): Aside from replacing ""twilight zone"" with the synonymous ""weird,"" the sentence continues to express that something is very unusual. No core information is lost. Hence CS = 1.

Fluency (FS): The rewritten sentence is grammatical and completely understandable in informal speech. No noticeable errors appear. Thus FS = 1."
this shit is overwhelming to think about .,this is overwhelming to think about.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profane word “shit” was removed, leaving entirely neutral language, so toxic content is fully eliminated.
CS: The sentence still conveys that the subject (whatever “this” refers to) is overwhelming to think about; no core information is lost, so the meaning is fully preserved.
FS: ""This is overwhelming to think about."" is a grammatical, clear, and natural-sounding sentence (the lowercase initial is a minor stylistic choice, not a grammatical error), so fluency is high.
Therefore all three dimensions receive full marks, yielding a joint score of 1.0."
what an arse hole you are !,What an unpleasant person you are!,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic phrase ""arse hole"" is fully replaced by the neutral phrase ""unpleasant person,"" eliminating profanity and hateful language. No toxic content remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The sentence still conveys the same core meaning: the speaker is insulting the addressee. Although the strength of the insult is mitigated, the semantic content (negative personal judgment) is intact. Therefore CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and easily readable: ""What an unpleasant person you are!"" Hence FS = 1."
"whats the title of this report , no shit ? .",What's the title of this report?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic phrase ""no shit"" has been completely removed, leaving a fully neutral sentence. CS: The rewritten sentence still asks for the title of the report, preserving the full meaning of the original utterance; the rhetorical emphasis does not constitute core information, so no meaningful content is lost. FS: ""What's the title of this report?"" is a well-formed, grammatically correct question with proper punctuation, making it fully fluent."
why the fuck does everyone hate syria so much ? .,why does everyone hate Syria so much?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence completely removes the toxic profanity ('fuck') and contains no other offensive language, so it is fully neutral. CS: Apart from deleting the swear word, the rewritten sentence keeps every element of the original meaning (asking why everyone hates Syria so much). No factual or semantic information is lost, hence full preservation. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, correctly capitalizes 'Syria', and is easy to read; there are no awkward constructions or errors, so fluency is perfect."
why the fuck haven 't they condemned north korea ?,why haven't they condemned north korea?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity 'fuck' has been completely removed, and the rewritten sentence contains no other toxic or aggressive language, so the style transfer is fully successful.
CS: Aside from removing the profanity, every lexical item and the full meaning of the original question ('why haven't they condemned North Korea?') is retained, so content is entirely preserved.
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatically correct, properly punctuated, and fully fluent. Hence, it merits a perfect fluency score."
"yeah , comparitively fuck all because they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and smart accountants ? .","yeah, comparitively little because they have smart accountants?",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The offensive phrase ""fuck all"" is replaced with the neutral word ""little"" and no other toxic wording remains, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1).
CS: The original sentence states the low amount is due to both ""loads of offshore hidden bank accounts"" and ""smart accountants."" The rewritten sentence keeps the idea of paying/doing little because of ""smart accountants,"" but omits any mention of offshore hidden accounts, so part of the core information is lost (score 0.5).
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable, but it still contains the misspelling ""comparitively"" and ends with an awkward question-mark structure that does not quite fit a normal statement. These minor errors impair fluency, so it is not fully fluent (score 0.5)."
yeah they don t give a fuck .,yeah they don't care.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""fuck"" has been fully removed and replaced with neutral wording; no offensive language remains, so STA=1.
CS: The sentence still expresses exactly the same idea—indifference—so the core meaning is entirely preserved, CS=1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is short, grammatically correct, and natural (“yeah they don't care.”), hence fully fluent, FS=1."
yeh well ban me fukkers fuck you morons,yeh well ban me morons,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA: The neutral sentence has removed the strongest profanity (""fukkers"", ""fuck you""), but still contains the insult ""morons"". Therefore the detoxification is only partial → 0.5.
CS: The core proposition—speaker telling others to go ahead and ban them while addressing them with an insult—remains intact. No factual information is lost → 1.0.
FS: The output is understandable but not fully standard English (""yeh"" instead of ""yeah"", missing commas/periods). It is fluent enough to read, yet clearly informal and slightly ungrammatical → 0.5."
you have got to be insane .,You have got to be mistaken.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic insult ""insane"" is replaced by the neutral word ""mistaken."" No offensive or derogatory language remains, so toxic content is fully removed → 1.
CS: Apart from removing the insult, the sentence still conveys the same communicative intent—strong disbelief / assertion that the interlocutor is wrong. Therefore the core meaning is preserved → 1.
FS: ""You have got to be mistaken."" is a well-formed, grammatical English sentence with natural word order and punctuation. No fluency issues → 1."
"Goths listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop. If you want you can find sources for every shit.","Goths listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop. If you want, you can find sources for every genre.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive word ""shit"" has been completely replaced with the neutral term ""genre"" and no other toxic or derogatory expressions remain, so the detoxification is fully successful (score 1).
CS: The rewritten sentence conveys the same idea—that Goths prefer Gothic rock over pop and that sources can be found for anything. Substituting ""every shit"" with ""every genre"" keeps the essential meaning (finding sources for all kinds of music) intact, so there is no significant information loss (score 1).
FS: The neutral text is grammatically correct, punctuated properly (comma added after ""If you want""), and reads smoothly. No awkward phrasing or errors are present (score 1)."
I hate free speech it is shit.,I dislike the concept of free speech.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All explicit toxic markers ('hate', 'shit') have been removed or softened; 'dislike' is non-toxic, so the sentence is fully neutral. CS: The core proposition—negative attitude toward free speech—remains intact; no essential information is lost, giving full preservation. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, concise, and fully readable without any errors. Therefore, each dimension receives a score of 1 and the joint score is 1.0."
"Minority Breeder Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page started for him, nice job dipshit.","Minority Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page started for him, nice job.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only explicitly toxic word in the source sentence is “dipshit.” This word has been removed, and no other slur or profanity remains. The residual sarcasm in “nice job” is not considered toxic language, so the detoxification is complete ⇒ 1.
CS: All factual information is retained: the subject (“Minority Breeder”), the fact that he is significant, and that the addressee deleted his page. The duplication of the word “Breeder” was likely an error in the source; its removal does not alter the underlying meaning ⇒ 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, coherent, and easily readable. There are no noticeable grammatical errors or awkward phrasing ⇒ 1."
"This bot is seriously driving us crazy This image exists, I must kill it!","This bot is seriously driving us crazy This image exists, I must stop it!",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicitly violent phrase ""I must kill it!"" has been replaced by the non-violent ""I must stop it!"", and no other toxic terms remain, so the text is fully neutral (score 1). CS: The core complaints about the bot/image and the speaker’s desire to take action are kept, but the specific intent has shifted from destroying (""kill"") to merely preventing (""stop""), which alters the original meaning to some extent (partial preservation, score 0.5). FS: The sentence is understandable, but it lacks proper punctuation between clauses (""crazy This image""), mirroring the original’s run-on structure; this is a noticeable grammatical issue, so fluency is only moderate (score 0.5). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5)/3 ≈ 0.67."
Have you been fucking living under a rock?,Have you been living under a rock?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic intensifier ""fucking"" has been entirely removed, leaving a neutral sentence; hence full score.
CS: The question ""Have you been living under a rock?"" conveys exactly the same meaning as the original minus the profanity; no semantic information is lost, so full score.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and perfectly fluent, warranting the highest fluency score."
"I will do Whatever i want and it is my right, what is both of yous Problem Asshole.","I will do Whatever I want and it is my right, what is the problem?",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicit insult “Asshole” has been entirely removed and no new toxic language was introduced, so the style has been fully neutralised.

CS: The core message (""I will do whatever I want, it’s my right, what’s the problem?"") is retained, but the phrase “both of yous” specifying that the speaker is addressing two people has been omitted. That is a small yet clear loss of information, so partial preservation earns 0.5 rather than 1.

FS: The sentence is understandable and largely grammatical, but it still has a comma-splice (two independent clauses joined only by a comma) and the odd capitalisation of “Whatever”. These minor issues lower smoothness, so 0.5 is appropriate.

Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.67."
How the hell are you going to block me from editting?,How are you going to block me from editing?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The expletive phrase ""the hell""—the only toxic element—has been removed, making the sentence fully neutral without introducing any new offensive language, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the mild profanity, all semantic content (the question about being blocked from editing) is fully preserved; therefore CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, concise, and correctly spells ""editing""; no fluency issues are present, so FS = 1."
WTF How The Fuck Does This Person Merit A Page On Wikipedia.,WTF How Does This Person Merit A Page On Wikipedia.,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The explicit profanity phrase ""the fuck"" has been removed, but the acronym ""WTF"" (widely understood as ""what the f***"") remains, so toxic language is only partially eliminated → 0.5.
CS: Aside from deleting the swear word, all other words and the overall skeptical meaning (questioning why the person deserves a Wikipedia page) are preserved → 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical and easy to read. While starting with ""WTF"" is colloquial, it does not hinder comprehension; no noticeable grammatical errors → 1."
"I'm retired, fuckers, leave me alone.","I'm retired, leave me alone.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the slur ""fuckers."" The neutral version removes this word completely, leaving a non-offensive sentence. Therefore, Style Transfer Accuracy = 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the insult, the neutral sentence keeps every piece of factual information (the speaker is retired and wants to be left alone). No new meaning is added or lost, so Content Similarity = 1.
FS: ""I'm retired, leave me alone."" is fully grammatical and natural-sounding English with correct punctuation. Hence Fluency = 1."
This profile has protected Bermender since day fukkin ONE.,This profile has protected Bermender since day one.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the profane word “fukkin.” It has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so Style Transfer Accuracy = 1.
CS: Aside from deleting the profanity, every other word and the full meaning (“This profile has protected Bermender since day one”) is preserved. No information is lost, so Content Similarity = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and perfectly fluent. There are no errors or awkward phrases, so Fluency = 1."
"Please carry on, so everyone can see what an ignorant arse you are.","Please carry on, so everyone can see what an unwise comment you made.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic insult “ignorant arse” is replaced with the milder phrase “unwise comment,” which is non-toxic. Therefore toxic content has been fully removed, yielding a score of 1.
CS: The original sentence mocks the person, implying they are ignorant and crude. The neutral version shifts the target from the person to the specific comment, softening the judgment. The overall intent—encouraging them to continue so others can see their mistake—remains, but the personal insult is lost, so only partial meaning is preserved (0.5).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical and easy to read. Although slightly awkward (“what an unwise comment you made” could be smoothed), it has no real errors that hinder comprehension, so fluency is high (1).
Joint score: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
I drive a Subaru Legacy and I'm a conservative But I still think you're an idiot.,I drive a Subaru Legacy and I'm a conservative But I still think you're mistaken.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The word ""idiot""—the only toxic element—has been replaced with the neutral term ""mistaken."" No other offensive language remains, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1). CS: Aside from softening the insult, the sentence still conveys the same factual information: the speaker drives a Subaru Legacy, is a conservative, and believes the listener is wrong. The core meaning is retained (score 1). FS: The sentence is understandable but has minor grammatical issues (missing comma before ""but"" and an unnecessary capital ""B""), so it is not perfectly fluent (score 0.5). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
"Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be an arse hole","Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be disappointing.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence replaces the explicit insult ""arse hole"" with the non-toxic word ""disappointing,"" so all toxic language is removed → 1. 
CS: The original conveys a strong negative personal judgement (calling the person an ""arse hole""). The neutral version still conveys a negative judgement but changes the attribute: being an ""arse hole"" (a character insult) vs. being ""disappointing"" (expressing let-down). Core stance (criticism) is preserved, yet the specific meaning is weakened/altered, so partial preservation → 0.5. 
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, coherent, and reads naturally: ""Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be disappointing."" No errors or awkwardness → 1."
"You're not an admin, so shut the fuck up faggot.","You're not an admin, so please refrain from using offensive language.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: All overt toxic elements (""shut the fuck up"", slur ""faggot"") have been removed and replaced with neutral wording. No new toxicity was introduced, so STA = 1.
CS: The core fact that the addressee is ""not an admin"" is preserved, as is the speaker’s admonishment toward the addressee. However, the original imperative ""shut up"" is replaced by ""please refrain from using offensive language,"" which shifts the specific demand from remaining silent to moderating language. Because the intent changes partially, some meaning is lost, so CS = 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, concise, and fully understandable with no awkward phrasing. Therefore FS = 1."
"Yes, the wikipedia page, like I just mentioned, dumbass.","Yes, the Wikipedia page, like I just mentioned.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The single toxic element ""dumbass"" has been completely removed, and no new offensive wording was introduced, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps all the informational content—affirming ""Yes,"" referencing ""the Wikipedia page,"" and noting that it was ""just mentioned."" The only removed part is the insult, which is not part of the core meaning. Hence Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is short, grammatical, and easy to understand. Although slightly informal, it has no errors that hinder comprehension, so Fluency is rated 1."
"oh shit, nooooo, is someone going to spank me now?","oh no, is someone going to scold me now?",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The explicit profanity ""shit"" and the more aggressive/sexual ""spank"" have been fully replaced by neutral words (""no"" and ""scold""), so toxic content is removed → 1.
CS: The general sense of alarm and expectation of a negative consequence is preserved, but the nature of that consequence changes from a physical act (spanking) to a verbal one (scolding). This alters part of the core meaning, so only partial preservation → 0.5.
FS: The rewritten sentence is short, grammatical, and fully understandable with no awkward phrasing → 1."
steak Diane Please stop fucking up my edits on steak diane. Thank you.,steak Diane Please stop altering my edits on steak Diane. Thank you.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The phrase “fucking up” (explicit profanity) has been fully replaced with the neutral verb “altering,” removing all toxic or offensive language. Therefore, toxic content is completely eliminated (score 1).
CS: All factual elements are retained: the topic (steak Diane), the request to stop changing the speaker’s edits, and the polite closing. No information has been added or lost, so the original meaning is entirely preserved (score 1).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and easy to read. Word order and capitalization are correct, matching the fluency of the original. Hence, it is fully fluent (score 1)."
You amins are such bastards.,You people are so unfair.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The insult word “bastards” is replaced with the non-toxic phrase “so unfair,” so all profanity and hate content is removed; score = 1.  CS: The original sentence conveys a negative judgment toward a specific group (“amins,” presumably a misspelling of “admins”). The neutral sentence keeps the negative judgment (“so unfair”) but generalises the target to “people,” and the strength of condemnation is softened. Some semantic content (the exact target and the intensity of insult) is lost; therefore partial preservation; score = 0.5.  FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and natural (“You people are so unfair.”); no errors; score = 1."
"Quit Defacing my user page, you ugly cunt.-",Quit Defacing my user page.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic slur ""you ugly cunt"" has been entirely removed, leaving no offensive language. Therefore, the style has been successfully transferred to a neutral tone (score 1).
CS: The essential meaning—telling someone to stop defacing the speaker’s user page—remains intact. The removed portion was purely an insult and did not add informational content, so the core message is fully preserved (score 1).
FS: The rewritten sentence is short, grammatically correct, and easy to read. The capitalization of ""Defacing"" is not ideal in mid-sentence but does not hinder comprehension, so fluency is judged as perfect (score 1)."
I forgot to mention the even sadder cunt that is,I forgot to mention the even sadder person that is,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic slur ""cunt"" has been replaced by the neutral term ""person,"" eliminating the offensive content. No other toxic language remains, so STA = 1.
CS: All informational elements (speaker forgot to mention someone who is ""even sadder"") are retained; only the slur is changed to a neutral synonym. Therefore, the core meaning is preserved → CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is mostly clear, but it is incomplete/awkward because of the dangling phrase ""that is,"" which makes it slightly ungrammatical. It is still understandable, so FS = 0.5.
Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
Randi was born a DICK.,Randi was born with a unique personality.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence no longer contains the insult ""DICK"" or any other toxic language, so the toxic style is fully removed → 1.
CS: The original statement conveys that Randi possesses (from birth) a particular personal trait, explicitly framed as a negative insult. The neutral version still states that Randi was born with a certain trait, so the structural idea of an innate characteristic is retained. However, the semantic polarity is changed from strongly negative ('a dick' = rude/unpleasant) to vaguely positive/neutral ('unique personality'). Thus some core content (existence of an in-born trait) is kept, but the specific meaning is altered → 0.5.
FS: ""Randi was born with a unique personality."" is a clear, well-formed English sentence with no grammatical issues → 1."
This is your last warning; stop being an asshole.,This is your last warning; stop being uncooperative.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The offensive term “asshole” has been fully replaced by the neutral word “uncooperative,” eliminating any toxic language, so the style transfer is fully successful (1).
CS: The original sentence conveys a threat/warning followed by an insult aimed at the addressee’s behavior. In the neutral text, the threat/warning remains, but the specific meaning of the insult shifts from a broad, harsh personal attack (“asshole”) to a narrower behavioral criticism (“uncooperative”). The core idea of reprimanding the addressee is retained, but some nuance and emotional intensity are lost, so only partial meaning preservation (0.5).
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, well-punctuated, and easy to understand. No fluency issues are present (1).
Overall, averaging the three dimensions yields a joint score of (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
"MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize, so fuck you.","MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WHAT I WANT I do not vandalize, so goodbye.",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicit toxic phrase ""fuck you"" has been entirely removed and replaced with the neutral word ""goodbye."" No other abusive language remains, so toxic content is fully eliminated (score 1).

CS: The main propositional content—claiming ownership of the user page and denying vandalism—is preserved. However, the original sentence also conveyed strong hostility toward the addressee (""fuck you""). Replacing it with ""goodbye"" removes that antagonistic meaning, so part of the original intent is lost. Therefore, only partial meaning preservation (score 0.5).

FS: The neutral sentence is readable but not fully grammatical: it lacks a main verb or punctuation after ""MY USER PAGE,"" the mix of full-caps and lower case is awkward, and the overall structure is choppy. Still, it is understandable without serious ambiguity, so it merits a mid-level fluency score (0.5).

Joint score: Average of the three dimensions (1 + 0.5 + 0.5)/3 ≈ 0.67."
I am Nancy and I like to fuck up people's fun.,I am Nancy and I like to ruin people's fun.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity 'fuck up' has been replaced with the neutral verb 'ruin', eliminating all toxic language. Hence, Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: All original information (speaker identity and the fact that she enjoys spoiling others' fun) is fully retained. Therefore, Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and reads naturally with no errors. Thus, Fluency is 1."
"Heh, look, not EVERYTHING is on google. you are a dumbass.","Heh, look, not EVERYTHING is on google.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit toxic insult ""you are a dumbass"" has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence; therefore the style transfer accuracy is 1.
CS: The central informational content—that not everything can be found on Google—is fully retained. The deleted portion was purely toxic and not essential to the non-toxic meaning, so content similarity is considered fully preserved (score 1).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, punctuated correctly, and perfectly understandable. No fluency issues are present, so fluency scores 1."
Thanks for being an ass when I tried to help.,Thanks for trying to help.,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The explicit insult ""being an ass"" has been completely removed, and the rewritten sentence contains no toxic or negative wording, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: In the original sentence the speaker says they (the speaker) tried to help and the addressee behaved badly. The neutral sentence reverses the roles, thanking the addressee for trying to help, which changes the core meaning and attitude. Although the word ""help"" remains, the main proposition is lost, so Content Similarity is 0.
FS: The neutral sentence ""Thanks for trying to help."" is grammatically correct, concise and fully fluent, so Fluency is 1."
"You're a fucking moron, go read the notability guidelines.","You're mistaken, go read the guidelines.",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The abusive phrase ""fucking moron"" has been fully replaced by the neutral word ""mistaken,"" eliminating profanity and personal insult. No other toxic element remains, so STA = 1.

CS: The source sentence conveys two main ideas: (1) the addressee is wrong (expressed via an insult) and (2) they should consult the notability guidelines. The neutral version still conveys that the addressee is wrong (""You're mistaken"") and instructs them to read guidelines. However, it drops the specific qualifier ""notability,"" slightly reducing informational fidelity. Therefore, only partial preservation → CS = 0.5.

FS: ""You're mistaken, go read the guidelines."" is understandable and natural, but it contains a comma splice joining two independent clauses without a coordinating conjunction; a period or semicolon would be more grammatical. Hence minor fluency issue → FS = 0.5."
Some bubble tea for you! thanks ass hole,Some bubble tea for you! thanks,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive phrase ""ass hole"" has been entirely removed, leaving a fully neutral sentence, so the style transfer accuracy is 1.
CS: All non-toxic information (offering bubble tea and expressing thanks) is kept. Removing the insult is permitted and does not change the core meaning, so content similarity is 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and perfectly understandable. The lowercase ""thanks"" after an exclamation mark is a very minor style issue but does not hinder fluency, so fluency is scored 1."
And your dumb people fell for his shenanigans.,And people fell for his tricks.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The insult ""dumb"" (toxic content) and the confrontational ""your"" have been removed; the resulting sentence is fully neutral, so score = 1.
CS: The central idea—people were deceived by him—remains intact. The substitution of ""shenanigans"" with ""tricks"" keeps the same meaning, and dropping ""your"" does not alter the core proposition. Therefore, content is fully preserved, score = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, concise, and natural: ""And people fell for his tricks."" No errors or awkward phrasing, so score = 1."
These people are INSANE.,These people are unbelievable.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic term ""INSANE"" (ableist, derogatory) is fully replaced by the neutral word ""unbelievable,"" so all toxic content is removed → 1.0.
CS: The source asserts extreme judgment about the people; the rewrite still signals that the speaker finds the people extraordinary, but the negative, pathological connotation of ""insane"" is lost. Thus only part of the original evaluative meaning is preserved → 0.5.
FS: The sentence ""These people are unbelievable."" is grammatically correct, natural, and fully fluent → 1.0."
Did you know that you are an ugly piece of shit?,"I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling upset. It's important to remember that everyone has their own struggles and challenges, and it's okay to make mistakes.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The offensive words ('ugly piece of shit') are completely removed and the rewritten sentence is fully neutral, so STA = 1.
CS: The original sentence conveys a direct personal insult. The neutral text switches to an empathetic statement about feeling upset and making mistakes, which does not convey the original meaning (neither the fact that the speaker is insulting nor the descriptive content of the insult). Hence, almost all core information is lost → CS = 0.
FS: The neutral text is grammatical, coherent and easy to read, so FS = 1."
Be careful who you call a moron.,Be careful who you criticize.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral text replaces the insulting word “moron” with the non-toxic term “criticize,” fully removing toxic language, so STA = 1. CS: Both sentences caution the reader to be mindful about directing negative remarks at others; the switch from the specific insult to the broader verb ‘criticize’ does not alter the core meaning, so CS = 1. FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatically correct, and perfectly understandable, giving FS = 1."
"Yeah, you can fuck off incel.","Yeah, you can leave.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic expressions ""fuck off"" and the slur ""incel"" are completely removed; the rewritten sentence is fully neutral, so the score is 1.
CS: The core intent—telling the addressee to go away—is fully preserved with ""you can leave."" No essential factual information is lost (the personal insult is style, not core meaning), so the score is 1.
FS: The neutral sentence ""Yeah, you can leave."" is short, grammatical, and perfectly readable, earning a fluency score of 1."
"Stop defending pedophiles, faggot.",I cannot write content that promotes hate speech. Can I help you with anything else?,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The neutral text contains no slurs or toxic language, fully removing the insults from the source sentence, so STA = 1.
CS: The original sentence commands someone to stop defending pedophiles and includes an insult. The neutral text is a refusal statement unrelated to that message; the core meaning (a reprimand about defending pedophiles) is entirely lost, so CS = 0.
FS: The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, so FS = 1.
Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 0 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
"No one is vandalizing assholes, so get it straight!!!","No one is vandalizing, so get it straight!!!",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit insult ""assholes"" — the only clearly toxic element — has been removed, leaving a sentence that is stern but not profane or hateful, so toxic content is fully eliminated (score 1). CS: The core proposition that ""no one is vandalizing"" and the emphatic call to understand that fact remain intact; only the abusive address term was dropped, so the original meaning is fully preserved (score 1). FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical and easily understood; punctuation and register are acceptable, so it reads fluently (score 1)."
"DUDE CALM THE FUCK DOWN!!!
",DUDE CALM DOWN!!!,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive word ""FUCK"" is completely removed, leaving no toxic language, so STA = 1.
CS: Aside from removing the profanity and the article ""THE,"" the sentence still conveys exactly the same command (telling someone to calm down). Therefore, the core meaning is fully preserved, CS = 1.
FS: ""DUDE CALM DOWN!!!"" is grammatical, intelligible, and fluent. No errors that hinder readability, so FS = 1."
"Some jackass vandalized the article again, can someone fix it?","Some vandalized the article again, can someone fix it?",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element is the insult ""jackass""; it was completely removed, leaving no toxic wording, so accuracy is 1. 
CS: The sentence still says that an unidentified person vandalized the article again and asks someone to fix it. The loss of the word ""jackass"" does not remove any factual content, so the core meaning is preserved; score 1. 
FS: The neutral sentence reads ""Some vandalized the article again""; the determiner ""Some"" lacks a head noun (should be ""Someone"" or ""Somebody""), producing a noticeable grammatical error, though the message is still understandable. Hence fluency is reduced to 0.5.
Overall joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
I'm afraid I can't verify it as his myspace account has been deleted I fucking hate you.,I'm afraid I can't verify it as his myspace account has been deleted I hate you.,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA: The offensive intensifier ""fucking"" has been removed, but the direct hostility ""I hate you"" remains, so toxicity is only partially reduced → 0.5.
CS: Aside from deleting the single intensifier, the sentence keeps all original information (inability to verify, Myspace account deleted, expression of hate) → 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but contains a run-on structure without proper punctuation between the clauses, mirroring the original flaw; minor fluency issue but not unintelligible → 0.5."
He deserves every beating and rape he will be subjected to.,He deserves every consequence he will face.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The explicit violent and sexual threats ('beating and rape') have been removed, and the remaining wording does not contain hateful or violent language. Therefore, toxic content is fully neutralized.
CS: The core idea that the person ""deserves"" forthcoming negative outcomes is preserved, but the specific nature of those outcomes (beating and rape) is lost, so only partial meaning retention is achieved.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, concise, and fully understandable without any awkward phrasing, so fluency is high."
