any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,any of us who did half this would be held accountable already.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the vulgar language ('shit' and 'locked the fuck up') and replaces it with a more neutral expression ('held accountable'), achieving complete style transfer to a non-toxic form. However, the original phrase 'locked the fuck up' strongly implies legal or criminal consequences, while 'held accountable' is more general and could include non-legal repercussions, leading to a partial loss of specificity in meaning. Thus, content similarity is slightly reduced. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with natural language flow."
are they liars or just clueless ?,are they uninformed or just unaware?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the potentially offensive term 'liars' and replaces it with 'uninformed', which is more neutral, though slightly less precise in meaning. 'Clueless' is replaced with 'unaware', which is a close synonym and maintains a similar tone in a non-derogatory way. Thus, the style transfer is effective, earning a full score for STA. However, 'uninformed' does not fully capture the intentional deception implied by 'liars', leading to a partial loss of meaning, hence CS is 0.5. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, so FS is 1.0. The joint score is the average: (1.0 + 0.5 + 1.0) / 3 = 0.83."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .","as someone from la and an oilfield worker, i still say this person is not impressive.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the highly offensive expression 'piece of shit' and replaces it with the much milder and neutral 'not impressive', achieving full style transfer to a non-toxic form. However, the original strong negative sentiment and emphatic disapproval are significantly softened, leading to a partial loss of the core emotional intensity and meaning. Despite this moderation, the basic structure and intent of criticism are preserved. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, with no language errors. Therefore, Content Similarity is scored 0.5 due to the attenuation of sentiment strength, while Style Transfer Accuracy and Fluency both receive full marks."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","calm down, cnn.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'the fuck' is successfully removed and replaced with a neutral imperative 'calm down', resulting in completely neutral language. The core meaning of urging CNN to calm down is fully preserved without any loss of information. The neutral text is grammatically correct, concise, and natural in expression, demonstrating high fluency. This represents a successful detoxification with no degradation in meaning or language quality."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,China and Russia will use diplomatic pressure to address any concerns if those ships take any provocative actions.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the aggressive and metaphorical language ('big stick to smack Trump around') and replaces it with a diplomatically appropriate expression ('diplomatic pressure to address any concerns'), achieving full style transfer to a neutral tone. The core idea of China and Russia responding firmly to provocative actions by the ships is preserved, but the specific reference to Trump and the confrontational imagery is softened and generalized, resulting in partial meaning preservation. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent. Thus, Content Similarity is scored 0.5 due to moderate semantic generalization."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,cretins rarely care about facts.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text fails to remove the toxic term 'cretins', which is a derogatory insult, and thus does not achieve any meaningful style transfer; the original toxic language is preserved almost entirely. Therefore, Style Transfer Accuracy is 0.0. However, the core meaning is fully preserved as the sentence structure and intent remain unchanged, warranting a Content Similarity score of 1.0. The sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, so Fluency is scored 1.0."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,do people actually believe this??,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic term 'shit' is successfully removed and replaced with a neutral expression, resulting in a completely non-toxic sentence. The core meaning—questioning whether people genuinely believe something—is fully preserved. The neutral text is grammatically correct, fluent, and natural despite the reduction in punctuation; the triple question mark is simplified to two, which does not affect readability or meaning. Overall, this is a successful detoxification with no loss in content or fluency."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","Don't you ever change one of my edits, or I will be very upset.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the violent threat ('I will come to your house, and I will cut you') and replaces it with a much milder expression ('I will be very upset'), making the language completely neutral and non-toxic, thus earning a full score for Style Transfer Accuracy. However, the original text conveys an extreme level of anger and a direct personal threat, which is significantly downplayed in the neutral version. This results in a partial loss of the original intensity and intent, leading to a Content Similarity score of 0.5. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural, so Fluency receives a full score. The joint score is the average of the three: (1.0 + 0.5 + 1.0) / 3 = 0.83."
even bush knows he fucked up .,even bush knows he made a mistake.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'fucked up' has been successfully replaced with the neutral and formal equivalent 'made a mistake', completely removing the vulgar language while preserving the original meaning. The subject and context (Bush acknowledging an error) remain intact, and the rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, fluent, and natural in expression. Therefore, all three dimensions receive the highest score."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,Popeyes for doing this in the first place.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the profanity ('fuck') and expresses the sentiment in a completely non-toxic manner, achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, by simply omitting the expletive without adding a corresponding neutral emotional cue (e.g., 'I'm disappointed in Popeyes'), some of the original expressive intent—strong disapproval—is lost, leading to partial meaning preservation. The resulting sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, though slightly abrupt. Thus, content similarity is partially maintained, but fluency remains intact."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,getting my ass kicked by practice tests made sure that I learned from my mistakes again.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the potentially vulgar expression 'getting my ass kicked' by retaining it in a figurative but acceptable way, and the overall tone is not offensive, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0. However, there is a shift in meaning: the original refers to being defeated by 'gre practice tests' specifically and vowing not to repeat a mistake, while the rewritten version generalizes to 'practice tests' and changes 'never make this same mistake again' to 'learned from my mistakes again', which is vaguer and alters the temporal and intentional nuance—hence Content Similarity is 0.5. The Fluency score is 1.0 because the sentence is grammatically correct, well-structured, and easily understandable."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,getting stronger every month yeah I wish.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'fucking' is successfully removed and replaced with a neutral version while maintaining the original skeptical tone.

The detoxification is effective and natural."
have you ever been to r trees and seen all the shit people say weed can do ? .,have you ever been to r trees and seen all the misinformation about weed?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the vulgar expression 'shit' and replaces it with the more neutral term 'misinformation', effectively eliminating toxic language and improving tone. Thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0. However, the original phrase 'all the shit people say weed can do' refers broadly to various claims (exaggerated or not) about weed's effects, while 'misinformation' implies false or inaccurate claims, which adds a negative judgment not explicitly present originally. This slightly alters the meaning, leading to a Content Similarity score of 0.5 due to partial meaning preservation with some semantic shift. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and natural, so Fluency is 1.0."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .","holy shit, a cop got let go?.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully replaces the potentially sensitive phrase 'got fired' with the more neutral and professional 'got let go', which removes any implied harsh judgment while maintaining complete neutrality. The core meaning—surprise at a police officer losing their job—is fully preserved. The expression remains fluent, grammatically correct, and natural in tone. The interjection 'holy shit' is retained as it reflects emotional emphasis rather than toxicity. Overall, the rewrite achieves perfect style transfer, content fidelity, and fluency."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,how do you manage that?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'how the fuck do you manage that ? .' is effectively detoxified by removing the profanity 'the fuck' and redundant punctuation, resulting in the neutral and grammatically correct sentence 'how do you manage that?'. The core meaning is fully preserved, focusing on questioning how someone accomplishes something. The language is fluent, natural, and free of grammatical errors. Therefore, all dimensions receive the highest score."

i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,I accidentally read the title as laser machete and almost had a shock.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The toxic expression 'almost shit my pants' is successfully replaced with the neutral and formal phrase 'almost had a shock', effectively removing the vulgar language and achieving complete style transfer. The core idea of being extremely startled is preserved, though 'almost had a shock' is less idiomatic and slightly weaker in intensity compared to the original colloquialism, resulting in a partial loss of expressive nuance. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with natural word choice and no structural issues. Therefore, content similarity is scored 0.5 due to slight attenuation of the original emotional intensity."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,I did not vandalize anything.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the offensive term 'you dick', making the language completely neutral, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. The core assertion 'I did not vandalize anything' is preserved, but the original text includes an interpersonal element (addressing someone as 'dick') that conveys anger or defensiveness, which is lost in the rewritten version. This results in partial meaning preservation. The neutral text is grammatically correct and fluent, with no language issues."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,I don't care about sides!,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'don't give a flying fuck' is successfully replaced with the neutral 'don't care', which removes the vulgar language while maintaining the original emphasis on indifference. The core meaning of the sentence is fully preserved, as both versions convey strong disinterest in 'sides'. The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no fluency issues. Therefore, all three dimensions receive the highest score."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,I have toilet paper to wipe my bottom and no shortage of food.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text uses the vulgar expression 'my ass,' which is appropriately replaced with the neutral and more formal 'my bottom' in the neutral text. This change successfully removes potentially offensive language while maintaining complete semantic equivalence. The rest of the sentence remains unchanged and is factually preserved, ensuring full content similarity. The revised sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and fully fluent.

However, the original meaning is partially lost—the toxic text expresses frustration toward a specific user disrupting Wikipedia and implies accountability, while the neutral version generalizes to 'work together' without addressing the disruptive behavior or assigning agency.

"liar , liar pants on fire justin .","liar, liar pants on fire",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.25,"The neutral text removes the name 'justin', which reduces personal targeting and partially mitigates toxicity, but retains the phrase 'liar, liar pants on fire', which is still mocking and childish in tone, thus only partially removing toxic content. The core meaning is somewhat preserved but generalized due to the removal of the specific target. The language is fluent and grammatically correct, with no issues in readability."

The fluency is excellent, with no grammatical errors and natural phrasing. However, the original mention of 'offshore hidden bank accounts'—a key part of the critical meaning about financial evasion—is omitted in the neutral version, leading to partial loss of core content. Thus, content similarity is reduced to 0.5 despite the preserved general sentiment about disproportionate advantage."
yeah they don t give a fuck .,yeah they don't care.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'don't give a fuck' is successfully replaced with the neutral and equivalent phrase 'don't care', effectively removing vulgarity while maintaining a completely neutral tone.

However, the original meaning is slightly altered: 'insane' implies a strong judgment about mental state or irrationality, while 'mistaken' suggests a simple factual error, which is a less severe critique. This results in partial preservation of meaning, warranting a CS score of 0.5. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with natural language flow, so fluency is scored as 1.0."

The fluency of the neutral text is excellent, with proper grammar and natural expression. However, the original phrase 'every shit' likely referred more broadly to various trivial or low-quality things, not necessarily musical genres, so replacing it with 'genre' slightly shifts the meaning and results in partial loss of the original intent. Thus, content similarity is reduced to 0.5 due to this semantic narrowing."
I hate free speech it is shit.,I dislike the concept of free speech.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic language by replacing 'hate' and 'it is shit' with more neutral phrasing ('dislike the concept'), resulting in completely neutral style. However, the original strong negative sentiment ('hate', 'shit') is downplayed to 'dislike', which softens the intensity of the speaker's attitude, leading to partial loss of the original meaning. Despite this moderation, the core idea criticizing free speech is preserved in a generalized way. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with natural expression."

The core idea of asserting personal rights and questioning others' issues is preserved, but the shift from 'what is both of yous Problem' to 'what is the problem' slightly generalizes and weakens the original emphasis on addressing two specific people, leading to partial meaning loss. However, the sentence remains grammatically correct and fluent with only minor capitalization inconsistencies ('i' not capitalized), which do not affect readability, so Fluency receives a full score."

Thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0. However, the original insult targets the person directly ('what an ignorant arse you are'), while the rewritten version shifts the focus to the comment rather than the individual, slightly altering the intended emphasis and weakening the personal criticism. This results in partial preservation of meaning, warranting a Content Similarity score of 0.5. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and natural-sounding, so Fluency is scored 1.0.

However, the original speaker's intent was to dismiss someone due to their lack of admin status, while the rewritten version shifts focus to advising against offensive language, which may not have been the original speaker's sole point—this results in partial meaning preservation. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with natural expression. Therefore, content similarity is partially preserved due to a shift in implied context."
