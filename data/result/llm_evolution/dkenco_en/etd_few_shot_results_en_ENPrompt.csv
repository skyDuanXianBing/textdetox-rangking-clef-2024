any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,Those who have done even a fraction of what we have accomplished would have been imprisoned long ago.,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: All profanities (""shit"", ""fuck"") are removed and the sentence is phrased in neutral language, so toxic content is fully eliminated.
CS: The original sentence says that if ""we"" committed even half of some wrongdoing, we would already be imprisoned, highlighting a double-standard about punishment for bad actions. The rewritten sentence speaks of people being imprisoned for performing a fraction of the speaker's accomplishments (a positive notion), which flips the meaning from wrongdoing to achievement and changes the direction of the comparison. Core semantics are therefore lost.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and easy to read, showing good fluency.
Overall, perfect style transfer and fluency, but the central meaning is not preserved."
are they liars or just clueless ?,Are they truthful or simply misinformed?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The insulting words ""liars"" and ""clueless"" were replaced with neutral terms, so all toxic language was removed (score 1). CS: The original asks whether the subjects are deliberately dishonest (liars) or ignorant (clueless). The rewrite asks whether they are truthful or misinformed. The second part (clueless → misinformed) is preserved, but the first part changes from a negative accusation (liars) to a positive trait (truthful), reversing the meaning. Therefore only partial preservation of meaning (score 0.5). FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, capitalized, and reads naturally (score 1)."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .","As a resident of Los Angeles and an oil industry professional, I still believe this person is despicable.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The vulgar insult ""piece of shit"" has been replaced with the non-profane adjective ""despicable,"" eliminating explicit toxicity while keeping a neutral tone, so toxic content is fully removed (1).
CS: All core information is retained: the speaker’s identity (from LA, works in the oil industry) and the negative judgment about the same person; wording changes are purely stylistic, so meaning is fully preserved (1).
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, well-structured, and reads naturally (1).
Overall, all three dimensions score 1, giving a joint score of 1.0."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","Please, CNN, take a deep breath and relax.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The expletive ""the fuck"" has been completely removed, and the sentence is phrased politely; no toxic language remains, so score = 1.0. CS: Both sentences convey the same idea—asking CNN to calm down—so the core meaning is fully preserved, score = 1.0. FS: ""Please, CNN, take a deep breath and relax."" is grammatically correct, natural, and easily readable, score = 1.0."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,China and Russia will respond firmly if any ships from other countries engage in provocative behavior near their territories.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The aggressive phrase ""use a big stick to smack trump around"" has been replaced with the neutral expression ""respond firmly,"" removing threat-like and hostile wording, so toxic content is fully eliminated.
CS: Core idea that China and Russia would react strongly to certain naval actions is retained, but key details change: the original specifically targets ""Trump"" and ""those ships,"" while the neutral text generalizes to ""any ships from other countries"" and adds the new condition ""near their territories."" Therefore only partial preservation.
FS: The sentence is grammatically correct, capitalized properly, and reads naturally, so fluency is high."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,People who behave like this often prioritize their own opinions over the truth.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The insulting term ""cretins"" is removed and replaced with the neutral phrase ""People who behave like this,"" making the sentence fully non-toxic. CS: The neutral text conveys the same core idea—that such people disregard facts—in slightly different wording (“rarely care about facts” → “often prioritize their own opinions over the truth”), preserving the original meaning. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and reads smoothly, with no awkward phrasing. Therefore all three dimensions score 1."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,It's surprising to see that some people still believe in such nonsense.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profane word ""shit"" is replaced with the neutral term ""nonsense,"" completely removing toxic language. CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the key idea—expressing disbelief that some people believe the referenced statement—so the core meaning is fully preserved. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, concise, and fully fluent, with no awkward phrasing."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","Please do not alter my contributions, as I may feel compelled to visit your home and express my displeasure in a forceful manner.",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The explicit phrase ""I will cut you"" is replaced by the milder ""express my displeasure in a forceful manner,"" reducing vulgarity, but the sentence still threatens a visit and force, so toxic intent remains → partial removal (0.5). CS: The neutral text keeps the warning not to alter edits and maintains the threat of a home visit and potential harm, thus preserving the original core meaning → full preservation (1). FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, coherent, and reads naturally → fluent (1)."
even bush knows he fucked up .,Even Bush acknowledges his mistakes.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The vulgar phrase ""fucked up"" has been replaced with the neutral expression ""acknowledges his mistakes,"" fully eliminating toxic language.

FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fully fluent."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,"I learned a valuable lesson from struggling with GRE practice tests, ensuring that I won't repeat the same mistake.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity in “my ass kicked” has been completely removed and replaced with the neutral wording “struggling,” so the output is fully detoxified. CS: The neutral sentence keeps the main idea—difficulty with GRE practice tests taught the speaker a lesson that prevents future mistakes—without omitting essential information, so content is fully preserved. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, coherent, and reads naturally; no fluency problems are present."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,"I'm improving with each passing month, that's true. I hope so.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The profanity (“fucking”) has been completely removed and no other toxic language remains, so style transfer is successful.
CS: Both sentences talk about becoming stronger/improving every month and express a desire for that to happen, but the original conveys sarcastic disbelief (“yeah I … wish”) while the neutral version states it as already true (“that’s true”) and then adds ‘I hope so.’ The core topic is retained but the attitude/polarity is changed, so meaning is only partially preserved.
FS: The neutral text is grammatical and easy to read; although the comma splice is slightly informal, it does not hinder comprehension, so fluency is good."
have you ever been to r trees and seen all the shit people say weed can do ? .,Have you ever visited R Trees and noticed the various claims about the effects of cannabis?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity 'shit' has been completely removed and replaced with the neutral phrase 'various claims,' leaving no toxic language. CS: The sentence still asks whether the person has been to r/trees and seen the wide range of claims about marijuana's effects, so all core meaning is preserved. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, well-capitalized, and easy to read, with no noticeable errors. Hence full scores in all three dimensions."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .","Wow, I heard that a police officer lost their job!",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity ""holy shit"" and the informal word ""cop"" are replaced with the neutral interjection ""Wow"" and the formal term ""police officer,"" fully removing toxic or vulgar content. CS: The central idea—expressing surprise that a police officer was fired—remains intact; changing the interrogative to an exclamatory sentence and adding ""I heard"" does not alter the core meaning. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding. Therefore, all three dimensions receive full scores."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,"I'm sorry, but I cannot paraphrase that statement in a way that removes its toxic and offensive nature, as it is already a neutral question asking for information.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: All profanity ('fuck') has disappeared and the produced sentence contains no aggressive or offensive tone, so toxic content is fully removed (1.0). CS: The original sentence was a direct question ('how ... do you manage that?'). The produced text is a meta-comment about being unable to paraphrase; it does not convey the original question at all, so the core meaning is lost (0.0). FS: The new sentence is grammatically correct and easy to read, hence fluent (1.0). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 0 + 1)/3 = 0.67."
how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,"I understand that you are frustrated about the cost of living, but using strong language like that can be offensive to some people.

FS: The rewritten text is grammatically correct, coherent, and reads naturally, with no noticeable errors. Hence all three dimensions score 1."

CS: The neutral sentence retains all key information—misreading the title as ""laser machete"" and reacting with surprise/near loss of bowel control—so the core meaning is fully preserved. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and easy to read; although slightly wordy, it has no notable errors, so fluency is high."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,I did not commit any acts of destruction or defacement.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence omits the insult ""you dick,"" fully eliminating toxic content. CS: The essential proposition—denial of having vandalized anything—is entirely retained; removing the insult does not affect core meaning. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, well-structured, and fully fluent."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,I don't care about sides at all.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profane phrase “flying fuck” has been fully removed, resulting in a neutral statement.

CS: The neutral sentence keeps the two key facts—having toilet paper and having plenty of food—so the original meaning is entirely preserved.

It is great that the Pope is taking such positive actions, and I appreciate your enthusiasm.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The profanity 'fucking' has been fully removed and the rewritten sentence contains no other toxic or aggressive wording, so style transfer is successful.
CS: The neutral text retains the key idea that the Pope’s actions are considered great/positive, but it switches to a different speaker perspective and adds new content (a request to refrain from profanity and an explicit appreciation of another person’s enthusiasm). Because of this shift and added commentary, it only partially preserves the original utterance’s meaning, hence 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is clear, grammatically correct, and reads smoothly, so fluency is high (1)."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","I've been able to earn a decent income through online sales, and PayPal has been a reliable source of financial support.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The vulgar word ""shit"" is removed and no other toxic language appears, so the text is fully neutral. CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the two key ideas—earning money by selling online and PayPal helping with bills—without omitting any essential information, thus preserving the original meaning.

CS: The conditional situation (being found guilty) and the consequence (authorities going after him intensely) are fully preserved; substituting ""acted in cold blood"" with ""acted without remorse"" and ""persecute"" with ""pursue"" keeps the core meaning intact. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no awkward phrasing or errors."

CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the causal relationship and all key information: the issue’s importance, the school’s lack of concern, and the bullying/harassment timeline. No core meaning is lost. FS: The sentence is grammatically correct, flows naturally, and is easy to read. Hence all three dimensions score the maximum."
"judging by the shit i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .","Based on my experiences throughout my life, especially the time I spent with George W., I have observed that...",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The profanity 'shit' has been removed and the rewritten sentence is fully neutral, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0. CS: The neutral text conveys the same idea—drawing conclusions from personal experience over many years, particularly years spent with George W.—so the core meaning is preserved, yielding 1.0 for Content Similarity. FS: While grammatically acceptable up to the main clause, the sentence ends with an unfinished thought ('I have observed that...'), marked by an ellipsis, which makes it feel incomplete and slightly awkward. Therefore Fluency is downgraded to 0.5."
"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up","This is your final chance to behave. Please be patient while the page loads, as it may take a few minutes for users like you to access Wikipedia.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: All profanities (""fucking tosser"", ""cunts"", ""fuck"") have been removed and replaced with neutral wording, so toxic style is fully neutralised. CS: The notion of issuing a last warning is preserved, but the second clause is altered: the original says the speaker can quickly fix a page that the addressee is vandalising, whereas the neutral text talks about page-loading time and the addressee merely ‘accessing’ Wikipedia. This shifts the core meaning from reverting vandalism to waiting for a page to load, so only partial meaning is retained. FS: The rewritten sentence is clear, grammatical and natural-sounding, with no errors. Therefore STA = 1, CS = 0.5, FS = 1, giving an average j_score of 0.83."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .","Justin, your words are not trustworthy and your actions are questionable.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The childish taunt and direct insult (“liar, liar pants on fire”) are replaced by a polite, descriptive statement. No vulgar or insulting language remains, so toxic content is fully removed. CS: The original meaning—that Justin is being accused of dishonesty—remains intact. The slight elaboration about his actions being ‘questionable’ is consistent with the original accusation and does not change the core meaning, so information is fully preserved. FS: The sentence is grammatically correct, well-punctuated, and reads naturally. Therefore all three dimensions receive full scores."
my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,I believe that our recent addition to the team may have some questionable character traits.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The overt insult “dirt bag” has been replaced with the neutral phrase “questionable character traits,” removing all toxic or offensive wording, so style transfer is fully successful. CS: The sentence still conveys the speaker’s belief that the newly arrived person has poor character (i.e., is bad or untrustworthy). Although the comparative phrase “even bigger” is softened, the essential meaning—negative judgment of the new individual—is preserved, so core information remains intact. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without awkward phrasing or errors. Because all three dimensions score 1, the joint score is 1.0."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","I can't believe that number bricks can fit in a car, this is ridiculous.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: All overt profanity ('fucking', 'bs') has been removed and replaced with neutral wording ('ridiculous'), so the toxic style is completely eliminated.
CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys strong disbelief that a certain quantity of bricks can fit in a car, matching the core meaning of the original; no information is lost.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it contains a grammatical hiccup: it should read 'that number of bricks' rather than 'that number bricks'. This minor error affects readability, so fluency is rated 0.5."
noones asking you to invade shit .,There is no need to invade anything.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence completely removes the vulgar word ""shit"" and uses fully polite language, so toxic content is eliminated (score 1).
CS: The original states that ""no one's asking you to invade ..."", emphasizing the absence of a request or demand. The neutral version changes this to ""There is no need to invade anything"", which focuses on lack of necessity rather than lack of request. The core idea (invading is not required) is kept, but the nuance of ""nobody asked you"" is lost, so only partial preservation (score 0.5).
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and easily readable with no errors (score 1)."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,Focusing on international issues that we have the ability to address.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity 'fucking' is completely removed and the sentence is rewritten in a neutral tone, so toxic content is fully eliminated. CS: The original message—avoiding engagement in foreign matters we cannot influence—is conveyed by the rephrased idea of focusing only on international issues we are able to address. The shift from a negative ‘not doing X’ to a positive ‘doing Y’ keeps the same core intent, so meaning is fully preserved. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, concise, and easy to read; no fluency problems are present."

FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, clear, and natural. No fluency issues are present."
"ouch man , them swedes were dicks to norway =\","Oh dear, it seems that the Swedes were not very nice to the Norwegians.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The insulting word ""dicks"" has been replaced by the neutral phrase ""not very nice,"" completely removing toxic language. CS: The sentence still conveys that Swedes treated Norwegians poorly, preserving the original meaning and emotional nuance (mild dismay). FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, idiomatic, and easy to read. Therefore, all three aspects meet the highest score."

CS: The neutral sentence keeps the main ideas: (a) several saints, (b) canonization/recognition, (c) opposition to a negative authority figure, and (d) martyrdom. Word choices change slightly (""recognized"" vs. ""canonized,"" ""unjust"" vs. ""idiot""), but the core meaning is preserved; no key information is lost (1.0).
FS: The sentence is generally clear, but ends awkwardly with ""like St.""—the missing name leaves it feeling incomplete, creating a noticeable fluency issue. Otherwise grammar is fine, so it is understandable but not fully polished (0.5)."
read your own fucking link .,Please take a moment to review the information provided in the link.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive expletive and aggressive tone were entirely removed, yielding a polite request, so toxic content is fully eliminated.

CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the core idea—expressing a desire to get a (phone) number and mentioning “PM Sunset.” No substantive information is lost or added.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but the phrase “have a number PM Sunset” is awkward and slightly unclear; a more natural phrasing would be “have a number, PM Sunset” or “PM Sunset a number.” Because of this unnatural construction, fluency is judged as only partially satisfactory."

CS: The neutral sentence still affirms the existence of the Wikipedia page and that it was mentioned earlier; no core information is lost.

Please refrain from using offensive language in your comments.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The vulgar phrase “fucking up” has been entirely removed and the rewritten text is fully polite, so toxic content is fully eliminated.

CS: The original sentence expresses a strong negative judgment toward the addressees. The rewritten sentence conveys empathy, cooperation and positivity, effectively reversing the attitude and eliminating the core message of condemnation.

CS: The core message—asking the addressee to stop altering the speaker’s user page—remains intact. Although “defacing” is softened to “editing,” the intent (that the edits are unwanted/inappropriate) is still conveyed, so CS = 1.0. FS: The neutral sentence is clear and grammatical; while the comma before “it’s” could be replaced with a semicolon or period, it does not impede understanding, therefore FS = 1.0.

CS: The transformed sentence still conveys that the speaker forgot/left out mentioning a particular person whom they view negatively (“even sadder” → “even more disheartening”), so the core meaning is preserved; therefore Content Similarity is 1.0. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, coherent, and natural-sounding (“I regretfully left out the even more disheartening individual in question.”), earning a Fluency score of 1.0."
Randi was born a DICK.,Randi was born with a strong personality.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The insult ""DICK"" has been fully removed and replaced by neutral wording, so the sentence is no longer toxic.

I do not engage in vandalism, so take care of yourself.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The explicit insult “fuck you” has been removed and replaced with a polite phrase; no toxic words remain, so style transfer accuracy is full (1).
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the main propositions: it is the speaker’s user page, they will speak freely, they do not vandalize. However, the hostile intent toward the addressee is changed to a friendly farewell (“take care of yourself”), which alters part of the original meaning. Therefore only partial preservation (0.5).
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, punctuated properly, and easy to read, so fluency is full (1)."
I am Nancy and I like to fuck up people's fun.,"Hello, my name is Nancy and I enjoy spoiling others' enjoyment.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profane phrase “fuck up” was replaced with the neutral expression “spoiling,” fully eliminating toxic language, so the style transfer is completely successful.

CS: The core informational content—telling the listener that not all information is on Google—is kept; the added polite suggestion does not distort or omit any essential, non-toxic meaning. Therefore the original (non-toxic) meaning is completely preserved. FS: The sentence is grammatically correct, coherent, and natural-sounding. No fluency issues detected."
Thanks for being an ass when I tried to help.,I appreciate your understanding and support during my difficult time.,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The toxic phrase ""being an ass"" is entirely removed, and the resulting sentence is fully neutral, so score 1.0. CS: The original sentence expresses sarcastic criticism for someone's rude behavior; the rewritten sentence instead thanks the person for their ""understanding and support,"" which conveys the opposite meaning and loses the core idea.

It's important to be respectful when communicating with others. If you need help with something, I'm here to assist you. Let's work together to find a solution.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: All profane and insulting language (“fucking moron”) has been fully removed and replaced with polite wording, so toxic content is completely neutralized (score 1).
CS: The original sentence conveys two ideas: 1) a direct insult, 2) an imperative to read the notability guidelines. While the insult is intentionally removed, the instruction about reading the notability guidelines disappears entirely and the reply introduces new content (offers of help, working together) that was not present. Hence almost none of the original informational content is preserved (score 0).
FS: The rewritten text is grammatically correct, coherent, and easy to read, with no noticeable errors (score 1)."

And your dumb people fell for his shenanigans.,"Unfortunately, many individuals were misled by his actions.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic expression “your dumb people” is completely removed and replaced with the neutral phrase “many individuals,” and the rest of the sentence is expressed without any offensive language, so STA = 1.  CS: The core idea—people were deceived by someone’s actions—is fully preserved: “fell for his shenanigans” → “were misled by his actions.” The loss of the possessive pronoun “your” does not change the essential meaning, so CS = 1.  FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, concise, and reads naturally; no errors or awkward phrasing are present, so FS = 1."
These people are INSANE.,These individuals exhibit unusual behavior.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic adjective ""INSANE"" is fully replaced by a neutral description (""exhibit unusual behavior""), so all toxic tone is removed. CS: The original claim that the people are mentally unsound is softened to merely acting unusually; the core idea that something is wrong with them is retained, but the strength and specific meaning (insanity) are partially lost, so only partial preservation. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and reads naturally, hence fully fluent."
Did you know that you are an ugly piece of shit?,I hope you know that you are a unique and valuable person.,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The insult 'ugly piece of shit' has been fully eliminated and replaced with respectful wording, so toxic content is completely removed. CS: The original sentence conveys a negative judgment (calling the addressee ugly and worthless), while the rewritten sentence conveys the opposite (praising the addressee as unique and valuable). Because the core meaning is reversed rather than preserved, content similarity is essentially lost, leading to a score of 0. FS: The neutral sentence is clear, grammatical, and natural, so fluency is perfect. The joint score is the average of the three dimensions."
Be careful who you call a moron.,Watch out for whom you label as foolish.,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA: The offensive term ""moron"" has been softened to ""foolish,"" which is less harsh but still carries a negative judgment. Toxicity is reduced but not fully neutralized, so 0.5.
CS: The sentence still conveys the same caution about labeling someone with a disparaging word, preserving the original meaning completely, so 1.0.
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but somewhat awkward (“for whom you label as foolish” is not fully natural English). Minor grammatical/idiomatic issues lower fluency to 0.5."
"Yeah, you can fuck off incel.","I understand that you are upset, but it is important to express yourself in a respectful and non-offensive manner. Instead of using harsh language, you could say something like, ""I appreciate your perspective, but I disagree with you on this issue.""",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: All insulting terms (“fuck off”, “incel”) have been completely removed and replaced with neutral, polite wording, so toxicity is fully eliminated (score = 1).
CS: The original sentence simply tells the addressee to go away in a hostile manner. The rewritten sentence does not convey ‘go away’ at all; instead, it comments on the importance of respectful language and proposes an alternative polite reply. Therefore the core intent (dismissal) is lost, giving almost no preservation of meaning (score = 0).
FS: The rewritten text is grammatical, coherent and easy to read, with no noticeable errors (score = 1)."
"Stop defending pedophiles, faggot.","Please stop supporting child molesters, it's disgusting.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The homophobic slur ""faggot"" is completely removed and the sentence no longer contains hateful or aggressive language, so toxic content has been successfully neutralised. CS: The request to stop defending/supporting pedophiles (child molesters) is fully preserved; only the abusive slur—irrelevant to core meaning—was dropped, so the semantic intent remains intact. FS: The sentence is clear and understandable, but the comma joins two independent clauses and creates a slight grammatical error (comma splice). Because of this minor flaw, fluency is marked at 0.5 rather than perfect."
"No one is vandalizing assholes, so get it straight!!!","Kindly remember, there is no one causing damage or engaging in disruptive behavior. Please clarify your understanding correctly!!!",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic term ""assholes"" is removed and the tone is polite; no hostile or obscene language remains, so toxic content is fully neutralized.
CS: The rewritten sentence conveys the same core information: nobody is committing vandalism and the addressee should acknowledge that fact. Although wording is expanded (""causing damage or engaging in disruptive behavior""), the central meaning is preserved, so full credit is given.
FS: The text is understandable but a bit awkward: ""Please clarify your understanding correctly"" is redundant/unnatural and the triple exclamation marks make the style less polished. Because of these minor fluency issues, fluency is rated 0.5 rather than 1.
Overall, the average joint score is 0.83."
"DUDE CALM THE FUCK DOWN!!!
","Hey there, please take a moment to relax and gather your thoughts.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All profane and aggressive elements (“FUCK”, all-caps shouting) have been removed and replaced with polite wording, so toxicity is fully neutralized. CS: The core message—asking the addressee to calm down—remains intact; ‘relax and gather your thoughts’ conveys the same intent as ‘calm down’.

"Some jackass vandalized the article again, can someone fix it?",It seems that an unauthorized individual has once again made changes to the article. Could someone please review and restore the original content?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The insulting word ""jackass"" is replaced with the neutral phrase ""unauthorized individual,"" and no other toxic language remains, so toxic content is fully removed.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps all core information: someone (unknown) has changed/vandalized the article again and the speaker is asking others to correct it. The slight wording change from ""vandalized"" to ""made changes"" still conveys that the edits were unauthorized and need correction, preserving meaning.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, coherent, and natural sounding, with no noticeable errors. Therefore it is fully fluent."
I'm afraid I can't verify it as his myspace account has been deleted I fucking hate you.,"I'm sorry, but I can't verify it since his MySpace account has been deleted. I understand your frustration, but please try to remain calm and patient.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The explicit toxic phrase “I fucking hate you” is completely removed and replaced with polite wording, so the sentence is fully detoxified. CS: The primary informational content—that the speaker cannot verify something because the MySpace account was deleted—is kept. However, the original also conveyed the speaker’s personal hatred, which is part of the literal meaning and is omitted, and the neutral text introduces new content about the listener’s frustration and a request to stay calm. Therefore only partial meaning preservation is achieved. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, coherent, and reads naturally, so fluency is high."
He deserves every beating and rape he will be subjected to.,He will experience the consequences of his actions.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the explicit violent and sexual assault wishes contained in the original, and the wording is no longer toxic or hateful, so it earns 1.0. CS: The original asserts that the person ""deserves every beating and rape""—i.e., extreme violent punishment. The neutral version merely states he will face unspecified ""consequences of his actions."" It keeps the notion of negative repercussions but omits the specific violent details and the notion of deserving them, so only partial meaning is preserved, giving 0.5. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and natural-sounding, warranting 1.0."
