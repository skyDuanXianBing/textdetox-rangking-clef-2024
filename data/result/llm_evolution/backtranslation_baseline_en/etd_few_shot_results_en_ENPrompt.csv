CS: The proposition and structure are preserved—'any of us,' the hypothetical 'who did half this,' and the consequence 'would be locked up already' remain intact; only emphatic profanity is removed, not meaning. FS: The neutral sentence is fluent and readable; while 'half this' is colloquial, it is grammatical and clear in context."
are they liars or just clueless ?,are they liars or just clueless?,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"No detoxification occurred—the neutral text keeps the toxic terms 'liars' and 'clueless' unchanged, so STA=0. Content is identical to the original, so CS=1. The neutral text is fluent and correctly punctuated (space before '?' removed), so FS=1."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .","as someone from la and an oilfield worker, i still say this guy is not",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.25,"The neutral text partially removes the toxic expression ('piece of shit') but still leaves a vague statement ('not'), which doesn't completely neutralize the tone. The core meaning about the negative evaluation of the person is still present, but the removal of the toxic content is not fully achieved. The meaning is somewhat altered with the vague phrasing. The language is fluent and clear without any grammatical errors."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","calm down, cnn.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity ('the fuck') is fully removed, leaving a neutral imperative ('calm down'); no aggressive slur or vulgarity remains. CS: The addressee (CNN) and the core intent (telling them to calm down) are preserved exactly. FS: The neutral text is concise and grammatical; punctuation spacing is corrected, and while 'cnn' is lowercased, this is a stylistic choice rather than a grammatical error, so readability is fully fluent."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text removes the phrase 'to smack trump around' and leaves the sentence incomplete, which impacts the style transfer accuracy. The sentence still conveys the core message about China and Russia's reaction to the ships, but it loses the full neutrality due to the absence of proper contextual closure. Fluency is maintained, though the incomplete sentence affects its overall structure and meaning."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,People like this rarely care about facts.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text replaces the insult 'cretins' with 'People', fully removing toxic language (STA=1.0).

"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","dont you ever change one of my edits, or i will come to your house",0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"The neutral text removes the explicit violent threat ('cut you'), but it still contains intimidation ('don't you ever...' and 'I will come to your house'), so detoxification is only partial (STA=0.5). Core meaning is partially preserved—the warning about changing edits and intent to come to the person's house remain—but the violent action is omitted, altering severity (CS=0.5). The sentence is understandable but has grammatical issues (missing apostrophes, casual casing), so fluency is moderate (FS=0.5)."
even bush knows he fucked up .,even bush knows that he messed up.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'fucked up' is successfully replaced with the neutral 'messed up', removing the vulgarity entirely. The original meaning is perfectly preserved, and the neutral sentence is grammatically correct and fluent."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,I don't like popeyes for doing this in the first place.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The neutral text removes the profanity ('fuck') and expresses the sentiment in a non-toxic, neutral way. CS: It keeps the target (Popeyes) and the reason ('for doing this in the first place'), but it weakens the intensity from strong condemnation to a personal dislike, losing some of the original force. FS: The sentence is grammatical and readable; capitalization of the brand could be improved but does not hinder fluency."

getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,getting stronger every month yeah i wish.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The profanity 'fucking' is removed, leaving fully neutral language. CS: The neutral text preserves the original intent and semantics—it's still a skeptical/ironic statement ('yeah I wish') about getting stronger every month; only an intensifier was dropped, not core meaning. FS: The sentence is understandable but has minor grammatical issues (lowercase 'i' and a run-on feel without clearer punctuation), so fluency is acceptable but not perfect."
have you ever been to r trees and seen all the shit people say weed can do ? .,Have you ever been to r trees and seen all the things people say weed can do,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The vulgar term 'shit' is replaced with the neutral 'things', leaving no toxic or aggressive language. CS: The rewritten sentence fully preserves the original meaning—a question about visiting r trees and observing claims about what weed can do. FS: Capitalization is improved, but the rewritten sentence omits the final question mark, making punctuation incomplete; otherwise it is clear and grammatical, so fluency is acceptable but not perfect."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .","Oh my god, a cop got fired?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic phrase 'holy shit' (explicit profanity) is replaced with the neutral exclamation 'Oh my god,' removing vulgarity entirely (STA=1).

i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but fucking seriously .,i mean it's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The neutral text removes the explicit profanity ('fucking') and any aggressive tone, resulting in neutral language. CS: While it keeps the main topic (that the pope is cool/awesome), it truncates the sentence and omits the contrasting clause ('stuff but ... seriously'), losing nuance and some core information. FS: The neutral sentence is incomplete and ends with 'and', which makes it grammatically faulty though still broadly understandable."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","i sell quite a bit of stuff on there, and paypal has actually helped me",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Successfully removed the vulgar word 'shit' and replaced it with the neutral 'stuff.'

However, the phrase 'number of those spent with George W.' is incomplete in the neutral version, leading to a loss of some core meaning, hence a partial content similarity.

"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up","last warning you tosser, it takes meminutes to resolve a page so you",0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"The neutral text partially removes toxic content by omitting the most offensive language but still includes the term 'tosser,' which might still be considered mildly insulting. The original meaning is preserved, so the content similarity score is 1. However, the phrase 'meminutes' seems like a typographical error, which affects fluency, lowering the fluency score to 0.5."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .","liar, liar pants on fire justin.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text, with no change or removal of toxic content.

CS: Aside from dropping the intensifier, the propositional content (that 'number' would solve many problems if necessary) is preserved. FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but not fully fluent: it retains the misspelling 'alot' (should be 'a lot') and is missing a determiner before 'number' (more natural: 'A/This number will solve a lot of problems if it comes down to it')."

Core proposition—criticizing people for wasting emergency call time on trivial matters—remains intact; no information loss (CS=1).

However, the phrase 'I love an number pm sunset' is a bit awkward and likely meant to refer to a time ('pm sunset'). The core meaning seems partially preserved, but the lack of clarity around 'an number pm sunset' reduces the content similarity slightly. The language is grammatically correct and fluent, but the expression could be clearer, hence the 0.5 score for content similarity."

However, the phrase 'raped in the ass' is replaced with just 'raped,' which maintains the core meaning but still retains some sensitive and uncomfortable context.

they re both fucked up .,they re both failed,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA=1.0: The profanity in “fucked up” is removed; “failed” is non-toxic and neutral in tone. CS=0.5: The pair preserves the subjects and quantifier (“they…both”), but shifts meaning from a general negative state/condition (“messed up/seriously flawed”) to a specific outcome (“failed”), losing nuance and potentially changing intent. FS=0.5: The neutral sentence is understandable but ungrammatical—tokenization issue (“they re”), odd predication (“are…failed” implied), and missing terminal punctuation—so fluency is only partial."
