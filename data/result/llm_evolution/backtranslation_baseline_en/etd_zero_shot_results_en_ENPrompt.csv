any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,any of us who did half this would be locked up already.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy: The toxic words ""shit"" and the phrase ""the fuck up"" have been fully removed, resulting in a neutral sentence with no remaining toxicity, so STA = 1.
Content Similarity: Aside from the expletives, all informational content is preserved—same subject (""any of us""), same hypothetical action (""did half this""), and same consequence (""would be locked up already""). Therefore CS = 1.
Fluency: The rewritten sentence is grammatical and easy to read. Minor optional additions such as ""of it"" are stylistic, not errors, so FS = 1."
are they liars or just clueless ?,are they liars or just clueless?,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The neutral text is identical to the toxic text. Insulting words like ""liars"" and ""clueless"" are still present, so no toxic content was removed (score 0).
CS: Because the sentence is unchanged, the entire original meaning is fully preserved (score 1).
FS: The sentence is short, grammatical, and fully understandable. Although it begins with a lowercase letter, overall readability is not affected, so it is considered fluent (score 1)."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .","as someone from la and an oilfield worker, i still say this guy is not",1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The insult ""piece of shit"" has been entirely removed and no other toxic language remains, so the output is fully neutral (score 1).
CS: The original sentence expresses a strong negative judgment about the man; the rewritten sentence ends with ""this guy is not,"" leaving the statement incomplete and stripping away the negative judgment. Because the central opinion (dislike/insult) is lost and the sentence no longer conveys the same meaning, content preservation is essentially absent (score 0).
FS: The sentence is mostly readable up to the phrase ""this guy is not,"" but it is clearly incomplete and therefore ungrammatical. While still interpretable, the truncation harms fluency (score 0.5)."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","calm down, cnn.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the explicit profanity (“fuck”) that makes the original toxic, leaving only a neutral imperative. No other offensive language remains, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: Aside from dropping the profanity, the sentence still instructs CNN to calm down, fully preserving the intent and core meaning of the original statement, earning a Content Similarity score of 1.
FS: The neutral version is short, grammatical, and easily readable. While it starts with a lowercase letter, this is a minor stylistic point and does not impede fluency, so Fluency is scored 1."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.0,"STA: The neutral sentence keeps the toxic threat ""use a big stick to smack trump around"" entirely unchanged, so no detoxification occurred (score 0). CS: Most of the original meaning is still present, but the clause ""do anything foolish"" is dropped, making the condition of the threat unclear; therefore only partial preservation (0.5). FS: The rewritten sentence is truncated—it ends after “ships,” lacks a period, and is not a complete clause. It is still decipherable but clearly ungrammatical, so fluency is mediocre (0.5)."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,People like this rarely care about facts.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy: The derogatory word ""cretins"" has been replaced with the neutral term ""People,"" fully removing toxic language, so STA = 1.
Content Similarity: The transformed sentence conveys the same proposition—that individuals of this type rarely care about facts—without omitting any key information, so CS = 1.
Fluency: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and easily readable, so FS = 1."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,do people actually believe this?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity 'shit' and excessive punctuation have been removed, resulting in completely neutral language, so the style transfer is fully successful.
CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys the same meaning—questioning whether people believe the referenced statement—so the core content is entirely preserved.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, concise, and easy to read with no errors, so fluency is perfect."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","dont you ever change one of my edits, or i will come to your house",0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"STA: The explicitly violent phrase ""and i will cut you"" is removed, which softens the threat, but the sentence still contains intimidation (""or i will come to your house""). Since partial toxicity remains, STA = 0.5.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the prohibition about changing edits and the threat of going to the person’s house, but it omits the cutting/physical-harm component, which is part of the original meaning. Therefore only partial meaning is preserved → CS = 0.5.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but lacks capitalization and has a minor comma-spacing issue. These small grammatical flaws prevent a perfect score, so FS = 0.5.
Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.5."
even bush knows he fucked up .,even bush knows that he messed up.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicitly toxic word ""fucked"" has been replaced by the non-toxic phrase ""messed up"", so all toxicity is removed. CS: The reformulated sentence conveys exactly the same meaning—that Bush is aware he made a mistake—with no loss of information. FS: The sentence is fully understandable and grammatically correct; the lack of initial capitalization is a very minor stylistic issue that does not hinder fluency. Hence full scores in all dimensions."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,I don't like popeyes for doing this in the first place.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""fuck"" is entirely removed and replaced with the neutral phrase ""I don't like,"" so no toxic or offensive language remains (score 1). CS: The core message—disapproval of Popeyes for what it did—remains intact; only the strength of expression is softened, which does not alter the essential meaning (score 1). FS: The output sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fully fluent (score 1)."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,getting myself kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the profanity ""ass."" The neutral sentence replaces it with ""myself,"" eliminating the profanity entirely. No other offensive wording remains, so STA = 1.

CS: The core idea—doing badly on GRE practice tests taught me a lesson—is mostly retained, but using ""getting myself kicked"" is awkward and introduces a slight semantic shift (it could imply the speaker caused the kicking). Some nuance is lost compared with ""getting my ass kicked,"" which idiomatically means being thoroughly defeated. Therefore, partial preservation, CS = 0.5.

FS: The sentence is understandable but not fully fluent. Problems include the odd phrase ""getting myself kicked,"" missing capitalization of ""GRE"" and the pronoun ""I,"" and generally informal structure. These issues reduce readability but do not render the sentence incomprehensible, so FS = 0.5.

The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.67."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,getting stronger every month yeah i wish.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the profanity “fucking,” which has been fully removed in the neutral sentence, leaving no toxic language. Therefore, STA = 1.
CS: Aside from deleting the profanity, the neutral sentence retains the same proposition: the speaker skeptically/ironically wishes they were getting stronger every month. No core information is lost, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable, but it lacks proper capitalization and internal punctuation (e.g., “Getting stronger every month? Yeah, I wish.”). These minor grammatical issues reduce fluency slightly, so FS = 0.5.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
have you ever been to r trees and seen all the shit people say weed can do ? .,Have you ever been to r trees and seen all the things people say weed can do,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence replaces the toxic word ""shit"" with the neutral word ""things,"" eliminating the offensive language entirely. Therefore, toxicity is fully removed (score 1). CS: Aside from the lexical change, the sentence keeps every element of the original meaning—asking whether someone has visited r/trees and observed the claims about weed. No information is lost (score 1). FS: The rewritten text is readable and grammatically correct in structure, but it omits the final question mark, which constitutes a minor grammatical error. Under the rubric, this falls under ""some grammatical issues"" (score 0.5). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .","Oh my god, a cop got fired?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (1): The profanity 'holy shit' has been fully replaced with the neutral exclamation 'Oh my god'; no toxic language remains. Content Similarity (1): The sentence still conveys surprise that a police officer was fired—no core meaning has been lost. Fluency (1): The rewritten sentence is grammatical, well-punctuated, and natural-sounding. Hence all three dimensions score 1, giving an overall joint score of 1.0."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,how do you manage that?.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive phrase ""the fuck"" has been entirely removed, leaving a neutral question, so toxic content is fully eliminated -> 1.0.
CS: Aside from deleting the swear words, the sentence still asks exactly the same question; no information or intent is lost -> 1.0.
FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable but ends with the unusual punctuation ""?."" which is not standard and slightly disrupts fluency; otherwise grammar is fine -> 0.5."
how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,how do you think people afford houses and cars?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the original sentence is the profanity ""fuck""; it was entirely removed, resulting in a fully neutral question, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the expletive, every other word and the original informational content (inquiring about how people can afford houses and cars) is retained, so CS = 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is well-formed and fully understandable with correct punctuation and word order; the lack of initial capitalization is a minor stylistic issue that does not hinder readability, so FS = 1."
i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost scared,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The profanity in the source sentence (""shit my pants"") has been fully removed and replaced with a neutral word (""scared""), so the detoxification is complete.
CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys that the speaker mis-read the title (“titling”) as “laser machete” and experienced a strong fearful reaction. No essential information is lost, so full meaning is preserved.
FS: The sentence is understandable but not fully grammatical (""almost scared"" lacks an auxiliary verb such as ""was"" or ""got,"" and ""titling"" is awkward). These issues reduce fluency, thus a score of 0.5.
The joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,I did not vandalize anything.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive term “you dick” has been completely removed, leaving a fully neutral sentence, so Style Transfer Accuracy = 1.
CS: The key factual content—denial of having vandalized anything—is fully preserved. Removing the insult does not alter the core proposition, therefore Content Similarity = 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, concise, and fully fluent, so Fluency = 1."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,I don't care about sides.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive phrase ""flying fuck"" is completely removed; the rewritten sentence uses neutral language (""don't care""), so toxicity is fully eliminated. 
CS: The original sentence conveys the speaker's indifference toward ""sides."" The neutral version still states ""I don't care about sides,"" preserving the core meaning; only the vulgar emphasis is dropped, which does not affect the essential content. 
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and perfectly fluent. No spelling or structural issues are present."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,i have toilet paper to wipe my behind and no shortage of food.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The original toxic element is the profanity ""ass"". The neutral text replaces it with the non-toxic word ""behind"", eliminating the offensive language entirely, so STA = 1.
CS: Aside from the profanity replacement, every piece of semantic information (having toilet paper, wiping, no food shortage) is preserved. Therefore the core meaning is fully maintained, CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is grammatical, clear, and natural. Although it starts with a lowercase ""i"", this minor capitalization issue does not hamper readability, so the text is considered fully fluent. FS = 1.
Joint score: Average of the three individual scores: (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1.0."
i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but fucking seriously .,i mean it's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicit profanity 'fucking' has been removed and no other toxic or offensive terms remain, so the text is fully neutral (score 1).
CS: The main idea—that the speaker thinks it is awesome that the pope is cool—remains, but the ending ('and stuff but seriously') is truncated, losing the nuance of mild disbelief/emphasis present in the original. Hence only partial meaning retention (score 0.5).
FS: The rewritten sentence is readable up to the point it abruptly stops at the word 'and'; this fragment makes the sentence grammatically incomplete, though still partially understandable. Therefore fluency is compromised but not entirely broken (score 0.5)."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","i sell quite a bit of stuff on there, and paypal has actually helped me",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic word in the source is ""shit"". It is replaced with the neutral word ""stuff"", and no other offensive language appears, so toxic content is fully removed (1.0).
CS: Most of the message is preserved, but the phrase ""pay the bills"" is omitted. This removes part of the financial-help meaning, so the preservation is only partial (0.5).
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it starts with a lowercase 'i' and ends abruptly after ""helped me"", making it feel incomplete; punctuation is also missing at the end. These issues lower fluency but do not render it unintelligible (0.5).
Joint score: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.67."
"if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the shit out of him .","if hes found to have acted in cold blood, the feds are going to persec",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The neutral sentence has removed the explicit profanity (""the shit out of him"") and contains no other toxic wording, so toxic style is fully eliminated. 
CS: The main idea—if he acted in cold blood, federal authorities will take action—is mostly kept, but the sentence is cut off at ""persec"", so part of the predicate and the object are missing, causing partial loss of meaning. Hence 0.5. 
FS: The text is readable up to the truncation, but the word ""persec"" is unfinished and ""hes"" lacks an apostrophe. These issues hurt grammatical completeness and smoothness, yet the sentence is still understandable, so 0.5 rather than 0.0."
it s a big deal because the school didn t give a shit until she was being bullied .,it's a big deal because the school didn't care until she was being bullied,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence replaces the vulgar phrase 'didn't give a shit' with the neutral expression 'didn't care,' removing all toxic language. 
CS: The substitution keeps the causal relationship and all original information intact; the sentence still states that the matter is important because the school only reacted when bullying occurred. 
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, easy to read, and natural. The lack of a final period is minor and does not impede fluency."
"judging by the shit i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .","judging by the things i ve seen in my number years, number of those spent",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The toxic word “shit” has been replaced with the neutral word “things,” and no other offensive language remains. Therefore, toxic content is fully removed (score 1).
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the idea of judging based on experiences over many years, but it omits the phrase “with George W.” This removes a piece of core contextual information, so only partial meaning is preserved (score 0.5).
FS: The neutral text is understandable, but it ends abruptly with “number of those spent,” making the sentence incomplete and somewhat ungrammatical. Consequently, its fluency is only moderate (score 0.5)."
"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up","last warning you tosser, it takes meminutes to resolve a page so you",0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"STA: Most explicit slurs (""fucking"", ""cunts"", ""fuck"") were removed, but the insult ""tosser"" remains, so toxicity is only partially eliminated – score 0.5. CS: The rewrite keeps the warning and the idea that it 'takes ... minutes to resolve a page', but drops the final clause ""can fuck wikipedia up"", leaving the main point of the complaint unfinished; therefore only partial meaning is preserved – score 0.5. FS: The sentence is understandable, yet it has clear fluency problems: ""meminutes"" is a typo/word-merge, and the clause ends abruptly at ""so you"", creating an incomplete sentence. This makes it moderately awkward but still decipherable – score 0.5."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .","liar, liar pants on fire justin.",0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The neutral text keeps the exact toxic phrase 'liar, liar pants on fire justin', so no toxic content was removed. Score = 0.
CS: The neutral text fully retains every word and meaning from the source sentence. No information is lost. Score = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but lacks capitalization at the beginning and reads like a fragment rather than a complete sentence, which lowers grammatical quality. Score = 0.5."
my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,my thoughts are that our new guy might be a even bigger dirt bag.,0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The neutral text still contains the insult ""dirt bag"" without modification, so no toxic content has been removed (score 0).
CS: Aside from the minor article change, the sentence conveys exactly the same meaning as the original (score 1).
FS: The sentence is understandable but has a grammatical error (""a even"" should be ""an even"") and lacks final punctuation, so fluency is imperfect (score 0.5)."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","no way number bricks fits in a car, this is bs.",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The explicit profanity “fucking” is removed, but the slang abbreviation “bs” (short for “bullshit”) is still present, so toxic content is only partially removed → 0.5. CS: Aside from deleting an expletive that does not change factual meaning, the neutral sentence conveys exactly the same message (disbelief that a certain number of bricks can fit in a car) → 1. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical and easily readable; punctuation/spacing are acceptable and no new errors were introduced → 1."
noones asking you to invade shit .,noones asking you to invade.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence has removed the only toxic element, the expletive ""shit"", resulting in a fully neutral statement. Hence, STA = 1.
CS: Aside from dropping the swear word, the proposition ""no one's asking you to invade"" conveys exactly the same idea—nobody is requesting an invasion. Core meaning is fully preserved, so CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but not fully grammatical: ""noones"" should be ""no one's"" and it lacks initial capitalization and end punctuation. These minor errors lower fluency, but do not render it hard to read, so FS = 0.5."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,not messing around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the expletive “fucking.” It has been replaced with the neutral word “messing,” so all toxic content is removed (score 1). CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the entire propositional content—‘not … around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about’—unchanged apart from the style shift; thus the core meaning is fully preserved (score 1). FS: The sentence is grammatical, clear, and idiomatic. Although it begins with a lowercase letter, that minor stylistic issue does not impede readability, so it is judged fully fluent (score 1). The joint score is therefore the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1.0."
nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady as fuck .,nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The profane phrase “as fuck” and the negative descriptor “shady” are removed, leaving a fully neutral sentence, so STA = 1.
CS: The main idea—that the lack of footage makes the events look suspicious—is only partially preserved. The rewritten sentence stops prematurely and omits the conclusion (“look shady”), so some meaning is lost. Therefore CS = 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is a fragment that ends abruptly after “time,” lacking a main predicate. It is understandable but not fully grammatical, hence FS = 0.5."
number will solve alot of fucking problems if it comes down to it .,number will solve alot of problems if it comes down to it.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the expletive ""fucking"". It has been fully removed, and no other offensive language remains, so the style transfer accuracy is 1.
CS: Aside from deleting the swear word, every other word and the overall proposition (that the unspecified ""number"" would solve many problems if necessary) is preserved exactly. Therefore there is no loss of core meaning, giving a content-similarity score of 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is easy to understand, but it contains a spelling error (""alot"" should be ""a lot"") and begins with a lowercase word where a capital could be expected. Because of these minor grammatical/spelling issues, fluency is downgraded to 0.5 rather than a perfect 1.
Overall, the joint score (average of the three sub-scores) is (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random shit like this .,org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random things like this.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the word ""shit."" In the neutral sentence it is replaced with the neutral word ""things,"" so all toxicity is removed – score 1.
CS: Apart from replacing the vulgar word, every other lexical element and the meaning (that Wikipedia has articles on many random topics) is preserved. No information is lost – score 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable, but it still shows minor grammatical issues: missing apostrophe in ""there s,"" awkward initial token ""org,"" and lack of capitalization. These errors don’t block comprehension but reduce polish – score 0.5."
"ouch man , them swedes were dicks to norway =\","Oh man, those swedes were not good to Norway.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit insult ""dicks"" has been completely removed and replaced with the neutral phrase ""not good,"" so no toxic language remains (score 1).
CS: The sentence still conveys the same core idea—that Swedes treated Norway badly—without adding or omitting essential information (score 1).
FS: The rewritten sentence is fluent and clear. Aside from a minor capitalization issue with ""swedes,"" there are no grammatical errors that impede readability, so it merits the top score (score 1)."
people are idiots for wasting emergency call time on crap like this .,people are not wise for wasting emergency call time on stuff like this.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic words “idiots” and “crap” have been replaced by the neutral phrases “not wise” and “stuff,” eliminating direct insults and profanity. No new toxic language is introduced, so STA = 1.
CS: The core meaning—that people should not waste emergency call time on trivial matters—remains intact. Wording changes do not alter the factual content, so CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it contains minor fluency issues: it starts with a lowercase letter and the construction “are not wise for wasting” is slightly awkward (more idiomatic would be “not wise to waste”). These minor issues lower the fluency to 0.5 rather than a perfect score. 
Overall, the average (joint) score is (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
"quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some idiot hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .","quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some bad hierarch, even unto being",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The toxic insult ""idiot"" has been replaced with the non-toxic word ""bad,"" and no other toxic language remains, so the text is fully neutral (score 1). CS: Core idea that saints were canonized for opposing a hierarch is kept, but the clause ""even unto being killed, like st ."" is truncated—loss of the fact they were killed and the example saint—so only partial meaning is preserved (score 0.5). FS: Sentence is understandable but ends abruptly at ""even unto being,"" making it grammatically incomplete and less fluent; however, it can still be read without major confusion (score 0.5)."
read your own fucking link .,Read your own link.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""fucking"" has been completely removed, leaving a neutral imperative sentence; hence full credit. CS: The instruction to the interlocutor (to read their own link) is fully retained, so the core meaning is preserved. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and fully fluent. Therefore, all three dimensions merit a score of 1."
same crap going on in the pnw too .,same thing going on in the pnw too.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""crap"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""thing,"" removing all toxic connotation, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: The sentence still conveys that the same situation is occurring in the Pacific Northwest (pnw). No information is lost, so Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical and easy to read. A missing initial capital letter is a minor stylistic issue, not affecting fluency; therefore Fluency is 1."
"shit , i d love an number pm sunset .",I love an number pm sunset.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic word “shit” has been completely removed and no other offensive language remains, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1. 
CS: Aside from deleting the expletive, every other word is retained, so the core meaning (“I’d love … pm sunset”) is preserved; therefore Content Similarity is 1. 
FS: The sentence is understandable but has clear grammatical/lexical problems (e.g., “an number pm sunset” is awkward/ungrammatical). Hence it earns 0.5 for Fluency. 
Joint score is the average of the three subscores: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped in the ass .,Some guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy: The original toxicity is largely concentrated in the phrase “to get raped in the ass.” The neutral version removes the crude anatomical detail (“in the ass”) and the disparaging adjective “poor,” but the core toxic phrase “to get raped” remains. Therefore, toxic content is only partly mitigated, warranting a 0.5.

Content Similarity: Aside from dropping the word “poor” and the locational detail, the rewritten sentence keeps all key information: a man robs a liquor store for $400 and later gets raped in prison. The central meaning, timeline, and monetary amount are unchanged, so CS = 1.

Fluency: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and easily understood. Capitalization, verb agreement, and punctuation are all acceptable. No evident fluency issues, so FS = 1."

still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,still standing up for your lying leader who loves himself and nobody else.,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The detoxified sentence removes the ableist slur ""crazy,"" which was the strongest toxic element, but it keeps the negative descriptor ""lying"" and the disparaging clause ""who loves himself and nobody else."" These retain a clearly pejorative tone, so toxicity is only partially reduced → 0.5.
CS: Except for dropping the word ""crazy,"" every other piece of information (standing up for, lying leader, self-love, disregard for others) is preserved. The core meaning remains intact → 1.
FS: The output is grammatically correct and easily readable. Although it starts with a lowercase letter, the sentence is fluent and free of major errors → 1.
Joint score: (0.5 + 1 + 1) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
sucked like nothings ever sucked before .,Sucked like never before.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The toxic term ""sucked"" is kept in the neutral sentence without any mitigation, so the toxic tone remains unchanged (score 0). CS: The neutral text conveys exactly the same idea – something ""sucked"" more than ever before – so the core meaning is fully preserved (score 1). FS: ""Sucked like never before."" is a short but grammatically correct clause, properly capitalised and punctuated; it reads smoothly (score 1). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."

that almost never happens excepts rarely in shit hole countries .,that almost never happens excepts rarely in bad countries.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic expression ""shit hole countries"" was replaced with the neutral phrase ""bad countries,"" eliminating the offensive slur. No other toxic language remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The revised sentence still conveys that the event almost never occurs, except rarely in certain (now described as ""bad"") countries. The core proposition and scope (rarity and location) are preserved, so CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it contains the ungrammatical phrase ""excepts rarely"" and lacks initial capitalization and proper punctuation. These issues lower readability, so FS = 0.5.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
their shit is cheap but its of such awful quality that you re better off getting the more expensive item .,their thing is cheap but its of such awful quality that you re better off getting the,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic term in the source is the word ""shit"". It has been replaced with the neutral word ""thing"", and no other offensive wording remains, so toxic content is fully removed.

CS: Most of the original message is preserved (cheap price, awful quality, advice to choose something else), but the neutral sentence truncates after ""getting the"" and omits ""more expensive item."" This drops a piece of key information (what the reader should get instead), so only partial meaning is kept.

FS: The sentence is understandable, but it is grammatically flawed and incomplete, ending abruptly at ""getting the"". This makes the text less fluent, though still decipherable, so it receives a mid-level score."
they need stop tratening people like morons .,they need stop tratening people.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only overtly toxic element in the source is the insult ""morons."" This has been completely removed in the neutral text, leaving no toxic or offensive language, so the score is 1.

CS: The neutral sentence keeps the main request – that ""they need to stop treating people"" – but drops the qualifying phrase ""like morons,"" which specifies how they are treating people. Because part of the original meaning (the manner of treatment) is lost, the preservation is partial, warranting 0.5.

FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but contains clear grammatical/spelling issues: missing ""to"" after ""need,"" and the misspelling ""tratening"" instead of ""treating."" These make it imperfect yet still comprehensible, so it earns 0.5 rather than 0 or 1."
they re both fucked up .,they re both failed,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The vulgar phrase ""fucked up"" is completely removed and replaced with a neutral word (""failed""), so no toxic or profane language remains. Hence STA = 1.
CS: The original sentence expresses that both subjects are in a very bad or ruined state. Replacing it with ""they re both failed"" conveys a negative evaluation but shifts the sense toward not succeeding rather than being thoroughly messed up. Core negativity is retained, but the semantic nuance changes, so partial preservation → CS = 0.5.
FS: The output is understandable but not fully grammatical; the contraction ""they re"" is missing the apostrophe and the verb phrase is awkward (better would be ""they both failed"" or ""they're both failures""). Thus it is readable but has noticeable errors → FS = 0.5."
this guy is a total sellout with no brains for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking .,this guy lacks the knowledge for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The toxic epithets ""total sellout"" and ""no brains"" have been removed or replaced with neutral wording. The resulting sentence contains no insulting or hateful language, so STA = 1.
CS: The original message conveys three negative claims: (1) the person is a sell-out, (2) they have no brains for business, and (3) they lack forward-thinking ability. The neutral version keeps (2) and (3) (though rephrased) but omits the notion of being a sell-out, so part of the core meaning is lost. Therefore CS = 0.5.
FS: The output is understandable but slightly awkward: ""lacks the knowledge for business"" would more naturally be ""lacks knowledge of business,"" and ""lacks the ability of forward thinking"" is unidiomatic. Minor punctuation is also missing. These issues lower smoothness but do not make the sentence hard to read, so FS = 0.5."
"this is a joke , are you all fucking retards ? .","This is a joke, are you all naive?",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive phrase ""fucking retards"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""naive,"" so all toxic content is removed (score = 1). CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the two main ideas—(1) the speaker says it is a joke, and (2) questions the other people’s understanding/intelligence—so the core meaning is preserved (score = 1). FS: The sentence is understandable, but the comma splice (it should be two sentences or connected with a semicolon/conjunction) makes the construction slightly ungrammatical. Hence only partial fluency (score = 0.5)."
this is some twilight zone shit,This is some twilight zone.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive word “shit” has been completely removed, leaving no toxic or profane content, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from removing the profanity, the sentence still conveys the idea that the situation is like being in the ‘twilight zone’ (i.e., strange or surreal). No core information is lost, so CS = 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable, but the phrasing “some twilight zone” is slightly awkward and sounds incomplete; a more fluent version would be “This is like the twilight zone.” Minor unnaturalness warrants FS = 0.5.
Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
this shit is overwhelming to think about .,This is too much to think about,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""shit"" has been fully removed, leaving a neutral expression; therefore, toxic content is completely eliminated → 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys that the subject (""this"") is overwhelming/too much to think about, preserving the core meaning without omissions → 1.
FS: ""This is too much to think about"" is a well-formed, grammatical sentence with natural wording and no errors → 1."
what an arse hole you are !,what a bad person you are,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic profanity ""arse hole"" has been replaced with the non-profane phrase ""bad person,"" removing the offensive language completely, so STA = 1.
CS: The sentence still conveys the same core meaning—an insult asserting that the listener is a bad individual—so information is fully preserved, CS = 1.
FS: ""What a bad person you are"" is grammatically correct and fully understandable with natural word order, so FS = 1."
"whats the title of this report , no shit ? .",whats the title of this report?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The phrase ""no shit"" is the only toxic element; it has been completely removed in the neutral text, so toxic content is fully eliminated → 1.
CS: Removing the expletive does not alter the core request (asking for the title of the report). The intent and information are fully preserved → 1.
FS: The sentence is clear and readable, but it lacks capitalization and the apostrophe in ""what's,"" which are minor grammatical issues. According to the rubric, this lowers fluency to 0.5 rather than 1 → 0.5."
why the fuck does everyone hate syria so much ? .,why does everyone hate syria so much?.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence has completely removed the toxic profanity (“the fuck”), so the language is neutral. Hence 1.
CS: Aside from dropping the swear word, all semantic content (question about why people hate Syria) is preserved. Therefore 1.
FS: The sentence is easily understandable, but the ending contains duplicated punctuation (""? ."") which is a minor grammatical error. This lowers fluency but does not render the sentence unintelligible, so 0.5.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
why the fuck haven 't they condemned north korea ?,Why haven't they condemned north korea?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The explicit toxic word ""fuck"" has been completely removed and no new offensive language was introduced, so the detoxification is fully successful (score 1).
CS: The neutral sentence conveys exactly the same question—asking why North Korea has not been condemned—so the core meaning is entirely preserved (score 1).
FS: The sentence is clear and easily understood, but the proper noun ""north korea"" should be capitalized as ""North Korea."" This minor orthographic error slightly detracts from perfect fluency; therefore, it receives 0.5 rather than 1.
Joint score: Average of the three sub-scores = (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
"yeah , comparitively fuck all because they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and smart accountants ? .","yeah, comparitively  all because they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic term in the source ('fuck') has been removed and no new toxic language was introduced, so toxic content is fully neutralised (score 1).
CS: Most of the main idea – that the subject has comparatively little because the other party hides money in offshore accounts – is retained, but the ending is truncated, omitting 'smart accountants' and leaving the sentence unfinished. This represents a partial loss of meaning (score 0.5).
FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable but not fully fluent: it ends abruptly with 'and', has double spacing after 'comparitively', and still contains the misspelling 'comparitively'. These issues lower readability but do not make it incomprehensible (score 0.5)."
yeah they don t give a fuck .,yeah they don't care.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity ""fuck"" has been fully removed and replaced with neutral language; no toxic wording remains, so the style transfer is completely successful.
CS: ""Don't give a fuck"" colloquially means ""don't care."" The rewritten sentence conveys exactly the same idea (lack of concern) with no loss of information, therefore the core meaning is fully preserved.
FS: The sentence ""yeah they don't care."" is grammatically correct, coherent, and natural-sounding. There are no errors or awkward constructions, so fluency is high."
yeh well ban me fukkers fuck you morons,yeh well ban me,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence has completely removed the toxic expressions (""fukkers"", ""fuck you"", ""morons""), leaving only non-offensive words, so toxicity is fully eliminated.
CS: The original propositional content – the speaker saying ""yeh well ban me"" – is fully preserved. The only material that was dropped consists exclusively of toxic insults, which are not required to keep the factual meaning. Therefore no core information is lost.
FS: The resulting sentence is short but grammatically correct and easily understandable. Although informal (""yeh"" instead of ""yeah""), it reads smoothly and has no errors that impede comprehension, qualifying as fully fluent."
you have got to be insane .,you have got to be insane,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA): 0 – The neutral text repeats the exact toxic phrase ""you have got to be insane"", so the toxic insult is not removed at all.
Content Similarity (CS): 1 – The meaning and wording are fully retained (it is literally the same sentence), so no information is lost.
Fluency (FS): 1 – The sentence is short but grammatically correct and perfectly understandable; the absence of a final period does not hinder readability.
Joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 ≈ 0.67."
"Goths listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop. If you want you can find sources for every shit.","Goths listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop. If you want you can",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic element, the profanity 'shit', has been completely removed, and no new toxic language is introduced, so the detoxification is fully successful (score 1).
CS: While the first sentence is preserved verbatim, the second sentence is truncated, omitting the idea that one can ""find sources for every …""; thus part of the original meaning is lost (score 0.5).
FS: The first sentence is fluent, but the second sentence ends abruptly (""If you want you can""), leaving an incomplete clause and hurting readability. It is still understandable but clearly ungrammatical (score 0.5)."
I hate free speech it is shit.,I hate free speech.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The original toxicity is mainly the swear word ""shit."" The neutral sentence removes this profanity and contains no other slurs or harassing language, so the detoxification is complete (score 1). CS: The core meaning—that the speaker dislikes free speech—is fully preserved. Although the phrase “it is shit” is omitted, the sentiment of strong dislike remains, so no essential information is lost (score 1). FS: ""I hate free speech."" is a simple, grammatically correct, fully fluent sentence (score 1). Therefore, the joint score, the average of the three dimensions, is 1.0."
"Minority Breeder Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page started for him, nice job dipshit.",Minority Breeder Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive term “dipshit” and the sarcastic insult “nice job” have been completely removed, leaving no toxic or aggressive language. Therefore, Style Transfer Accuracy = 1.
CS: All essential factual content (that ‘Minority Breeder Breeder is a significant person’ and that the addressee deleted the page) is retained. The removed segment was purely abusive and does not alter the core meaning, so Content Similarity = 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable but slightly awkward: it ends abruptly without the object phrase “started for him,” and the repetition “Breeder Breeder” already feels clumsy. This mild awkwardness places it below perfect fluency yet well above incomprehensible, so Fluency = 0.5."
"This bot is seriously driving us crazy This image exists, I must kill it!","This bot is seriously driving us crazy This image exists, I must kill it!",0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The so-called neutral text repeats the original sentence verbatim, retaining the violent statement ""I must kill it!"". No toxic content was removed, so STA = 0.
CS: Because the text is identical to the source, it preserves 100 % of the original meaning. Therefore CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but has clear fluency problems: it is a run-on with missing punctuation between clauses (""crazy This""), and the overall construction is awkward. These issues reduce readability but do not make the sentence incomprehensible, so FS = 0.5."
Have you been fucking living under a rock?,Have you been living under a rock?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity ""fucking""—the only toxic element—has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence. Hence, full style transfer accuracy (1).
CS: Apart from deleting the swear word, every other word remains identical, so the core meaning (asking if someone is unaware) is fully preserved (1).
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and perfectly natural in everyday English; no fluency issues are present (1). Because all three dimensions score 1, the joint average score is 1.0."
"I will do Whatever i want and it is my right, what is both of yous Problem Asshole.","I will do whatever i want and it is my right, what is both of you",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The word “Asshole”, which carries explicit toxicity, has been completely removed and no other toxic slur or profanity remains, so style transfer accuracy is full (1).
CS: The main statement – ‘I will do whatever I want and it is my right’ – is preserved. However, the phrase “what is both of yous problem” lost the word “problem” and was shortened to the incomplete “what is both of you,” so part of the original meaning (challenging both people about their problem) is missing. Therefore, partial preservation (0.5).
FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable, but it has clear grammatical issues: lowercase “i,” missing punctuation, and an incomplete clause “what is both of you.” These problems hurt fluency, but the sentence is still intelligible, so 0.5.
Joint score is the average of the three subscores: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.67."
How the hell are you going to block me from editting?,How are you going to block me from editting?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic intensifier ""the hell"" has been removed, leaving a fully neutral sentence, so toxic content is completely eliminated.
CS: Apart from removing the toxic phrase, every other word and the intent of the question remain intact; therefore the original meaning is fully preserved.
FS: The sentence is grammatical and easy to understand, but it contains the misspelling ""editting"" (extra 't'), which counts as a minor language error. Hence fluency is downgraded to 0.5 instead of 1."
WTF How The Fuck Does This Person Merit A Page On Wikipedia.,How Does This Person Merit A Page On Wikipedia.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: All profane words (""WTF"", ""Fuck"") have been removed, leaving a completely neutral sentence, so the style transfer is fully successful.
CS: The rewritten sentence still questions why the person deserves a Wikipedia page, which is the core meaning of the original. Only the intensity is softened, not the meaning, so content preservation is complete.
FS: The sentence is understandable and grammatically correct in wording, but it ends with a period instead of the required question mark and uses unnecessary title-case capitalization, which slightly hurts naturalness. Therefore, fluency is marked 0.5."
"I'm retired, fuckers, leave me alone.","I'm retired, leave me alone.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the slur “fuckers”. It has been completely removed, resulting in a fully neutral sentence, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from eliminating the insult, the neutral text keeps every other piece of information: the speaker is retired and wants to be left alone. Thus the core meaning is fully preserved, so CS = 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is short, grammatical, and perfectly readable: “I'm retired, leave me alone.” Therefore fluency is flawless, giving FS = 1."
This profile has protected Bermender since day fukkin ONE.,This profile has protected Bermender since day ONE,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""fukkin"" has been completely removed, leaving no offensive or toxic language, so the style transfer accuracy is perfect (1).
CS: The rest of the sentence remains identical, so the meaning (that the profile has been protecting Bermender from the beginning) is fully preserved (1).
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and easy to read. The capitalization of ""ONE"" is unconventional but not ungrammatical, so fluency is considered perfect (1)."
"Please carry on, so everyone can see what an ignorant arse you are.",Please carry on so everyone can see how ignorant you are.,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The explicit profanity ""arse"" is removed, which lessens the toxicity, but the sentence still directly insults the addressee by calling them ""ignorant."" Because an insulting expression remains, the text is only partially detoxified ⇒ 0.5.
CS: Aside from dropping the word ""arse,"" the neutral sentence keeps the full propositional content (urging the person to continue so others can observe their ignorance). No information is lost ⇒ 1.0.
FS: The rewritten sentence is well-formed, grammatical, and easy to read; no punctuation or agreement errors occur ⇒ 1.0."
I drive a Subaru Legacy and I'm a conservative But I still think you're an idiot.,I drive a Subaru Legacy and I'm a conservative But I still think you're wrong,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicit insult ""idiot"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""wrong,"" so all toxic content is removed. CS: The speaker still expresses disagreement, but an insult has been softened into a statement of incorrectness. This changes the strength and nuance of the message, so some meaning is lost; partial preservation (0.5). FS: The sentence is understandable, but punctuation and capitalization are off (missing comma before ""but,"" capitalized ""But"" mid-sentence). Minor fluency issues warrant a 0.5."
"Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be an arse hole","Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be unsuitable.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The explicit insult ""arse hole"" is fully replaced with the neutral word ""unsuitable,"" eliminating toxic language, so the style transfer accuracy is 1.
CS: The original sentence conveys a strong personal insult, i.e., that Greenman is a contemptible person. The rewritten sentence merely states that Greenman is ""unsuitable,"" which keeps a negative judgment but shifts the meaning from a personal attack to a question of fitness or appropriateness. Some semantic content (harshness/insult) is lost, so only partial preservation—score 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, coherent, and easy to read. No fluency issues detected—score 1."
"You're not an admin, so shut the fuck up faggot.","You're not an admin, so keep quiet.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All toxic elements (profanity ""fuck"" and the slur ""faggot"") have been fully removed and replaced with neutral language. Hence, style transfer accuracy is perfect.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the key message—because the addressee is not an admin, they are being told to be quiet. No substantive content is lost or distorted, so content similarity is fully preserved.
FS: The neutral sentence ""You're not an admin, so keep quiet."" is short, grammatical, and natural sounding. No fluency issues were detected."
"Yes, the wikipedia page, like I just mentioned, dumbass.","Yes, the wikipedia page, like I just mentioned",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element is the insult ""dumbass,"" which has been entirely removed; the rewritten sentence is fully neutral, so STA = 1.  CS: Apart from deleting the insult, every other word and the conveyed message ('Yes, the Wikipedia page, like I just mentioned') is preserved, thus no loss of core information, so CS = 1.  FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and easily readable; minor style choices (missing period, lowercase 'wikipedia') do not hinder fluency, so FS = 1."
"oh shit, nooooo, is someone going to spank me now?","oh no, is someone going to spank me now?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The expletive ""shit""—the only toxic element—has been removed, and the rest of the sentence is neutral. Therefore, toxic content is fully eliminated (score 1). CS: Aside from deleting the profanity and shortening the drawn-out interjection ""nooooo"" to ""no,"" the sentence keeps the same intent: an exclamation followed by the question about being spanked. No core information is lost (score 1). FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, concise, and natural sounding: ""Oh no, is someone going to spank me now?"" There are no fluency issues (score 1)."
steak Diane Please stop fucking up my edits on steak diane. Thank you.,Steak Diane Please stop messing up my edits on steak diane. Thank you,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The explicit profanity ""fucking"" was replaced by the neutral phrase ""messing up"". No other toxic or insulting language remains, so toxic content is fully removed – score 1.
CS: Apart from the profanity substitution, every piece of information (request to stop altering edits on the Steak Diane page and the polite ""Thank you"") is retained. Core meaning is identical – score 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but the text lacks proper punctuation between the heading ""Steak Diane"" and the following sentence, and the second occurrence of ""steak diane"" is not capitalised. These minor grammatical/formatting issues affect smoothness, so fluency is judged as partial – score 0.5."
You amins are such bastards.,You are such bad people.,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.25,"STA: The strongly toxic slur ""bastards"" was removed, but the utterance still delivers a direct personal insult (""bad people""). This is less toxic yet not fully neutral, so partial success → 0.5.
CS: The sentence continues to tell the addressees they are objectionable, preserving the core insult. However, the word ""amins"" (likely identifying a subgroup such as ""admins"") is dropped, slightly altering the target and therefore losing some meaning → 0.5.
FS: ""You are such bad people."" is short, grammatical and easily readable; no fluency problems → 1.
The joint score is the arithmetic mean of the three sub-scores: (0.5 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 ≈ 0.67."
"Quit Defacing my user page, you ugly cunt.-",Quit Defacing my user page.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The abusive phrase ""you ugly cunt"" has been completely removed, leaving no residual toxic language, so STA = 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys the essential request (asking the addressee to stop defacing the speaker's user page). The dropped content is only the toxic insult, which is not part of the core informational meaning, so CS = 1.
FS: ""Quit Defacing my user page."" is grammatical and easy to read. Although the capital 'D' in ""Defacing"" is unconventional in mid-sentence, it does not hinder comprehension, so the sentence is considered fully fluent; FS = 1."
I forgot to mention the even sadder cunt that is,I forgot to mention the even sadder person that is,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic slur ""cunt"" has been completely replaced with the neutral word ""person,"" removing all offensive language, so the style transfer accuracy is 1.
CS: Aside from substituting the offensive term, every other word remains identical. The sentence still refers to someone as the ""even sadder"" individual the speaker forgot to mention, so the core meaning is fully preserved. Therefore, content similarity is 1.
FS: The resulting sentence is understandable but grammatically incomplete; it ends with ""that is,"" leaving the reader expecting additional information. This partial ungrammaticality warrants a 0.5 for fluency rather than a full score.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
Randi was born a DICK.,Randi was born a bad person.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive slur ""DICK"" has been replaced with the mild phrase ""bad person,"" which is not profane or hateful, so the toxic content is fully removed – score 1.

"MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize, so fuck you.",My USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic fragment in the source is the insult ""fuck you"". It has been completely removed, and no other toxic language remains, so the style transfer is fully successful (1).
CS: All non-toxic informational content (speaker’s ownership of the user page, intention to say what they want, and claim of not vandalizing) is kept. Removing the insult does not alter that core meaning, so content similarity is judged complete (1).
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but still contains problems: inconsistent capitalisation, misspelled ""WAHT"", lack of proper punctuation, and awkward structure. These errors hinder smooth reading but do not make it incomprehensible, warranting a mid-level fluency score (0.5).
Overall, the average of the three dimensions yields a joint score of 0.83."
I am Nancy and I like to fuck up people's fun.,I am Nancy and I like to spoil people's fun.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profane phrase “fuck up” has been replaced with the neutral verb “spoil,” fully eliminating toxic language without introducing any new toxicity, so the score is 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps all key information—speaker identity (Nancy) and the fact that she enjoys ruining others’ fun—so the core meaning is completely preserved, warranting a 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and easy to read; therefore, fluency is perfect, giving it a 1."

CS: All non-toxic informational content (“look, not EVERYTHING is on Google”) is preserved. The only dropped material is the toxic insult, which is not required to be kept, hence content similarity is 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and natural-sounding. The lowercase initial letter is a minor stylistic issue but does not hinder readability, so fluency is scored 1."
Thanks for being an ass when I tried to help.,Thanks for being bad when I tried to help.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive word ""ass"" has been replaced with the neutral adjective ""bad,"" eliminating the insult and resulting in a non-toxic sentence, so the score is 1.

FS: ""Thanks for being bad when I tried to help"" is grammatically correct and fully understandable without awkward phrasing or errors, so fluency is rated 1."
"You're a fucking moron, go read the notability guidelines.",Go read the notability guidelines.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All toxic elements ('fucking moron') have been removed, and the remaining sentence is fully neutral, so score = 1.

Some bubble tea for you! thanks ass hole,Some bubble tea for you! thanks,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive phrase ""ass hole"" has been completely removed, and no other toxic wording remains, so the style transfer is fully successful (1.0).
CS: Aside from dropping the insult, the sentence still conveys that someone is offering bubble tea and saying thanks. No factual or core information is lost, so content is fully preserved (1.0).
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable and natural, but it starts the second clause with a lowercase ""thanks"" after an exclamation mark (""! thanks""), which is a minor punctuation/capitalization lapse. Therefore it is fluent but not perfectly polished, warranting 0.5.
Overall, the joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
And your dumb people fell for his shenanigans.,And your people fell for his antics.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence eliminates the toxic adjective ""dumb,"" leaving no insulting or hateful language, so toxic style is fully removed. CS: Apart from dropping the toxic adjective, the sentence keeps all core information—'your people' as the subject, 'fell for' as the action, and 'his antics' as an equivalent of 'his shenanigans.' Therefore the original meaning is completely preserved. FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and perfectly readable with no errors. Hence it is fully fluent."
These people are INSANE.,These people are INSANE.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The supposedly neutral sentence is identical to the toxic one and still contains the disparaging word ""INSANE"" directed at a group of people. No toxic content was removed, so the score is 0. CS: Because the two sentences are exactly the same, the original meaning is fully preserved, giving a score of 1.

Did you know that you are an ugly piece of shit?,Did you know that you are not good?,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.25,"STA (0.5): The profanity (""ugly piece of shit"") has been removed, but the sentence still directly insults the addressee (""you are not good""), which constitutes mild harassment. Therefore toxic content is only partially removed, not fully neutral.
CS (0.5): The rewritten sentence retains the central idea that the speaker is criticizing the addressee, but it loses specific semantic information (""ugly"" and the strong insult ""piece of shit""). Hence core meaning is only partially preserved.
FS (1): The sentence ""Did you know that you are not good?"" is grammatically correct, well-formed, and easy to understand, so fluency is fully satisfactory.

Be careful who you call a moron.,Be careful who you call.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The word “moron,” which constitutes the toxic content, has been removed, leaving a neutral sentence; no other offensive wording remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The original warns specifically about calling someone a “moron,” whereas the neutral version merely says “Be careful who you call,” losing the key idea of insulting language. The general caution is retained, but the specific object (“a moron”) is lost, so only partial meaning is preserved → CS = 0.5.
FS: The sentence “Be careful who you call.” is short, grammatical, and easy to understand. Although slightly ambiguous, it is standard English with no errors, so FS = 1.

"Yeah, you can fuck off incel.","Yeah, you can go away incel.",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The explicit profanity “fuck off” has been softened to the neutral phrase “go away,” which removes a main toxic element. However, the derogatory term “incel” is still present and used as an insult, so toxicity is only partially removed → 0.5.
CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys the same proposition—telling the interlocutor to leave and labeling them an incel—so all core semantics are intact → 1.
FS: The sentence is short, grammatical, and easy to understand. Apart from a possible optional comma before “incel,” there are no fluency issues → 1."
"Stop defending pedophiles, faggot.",Stop defending pedophiles.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicitly toxic slur ""faggot"" was completely removed, and no new toxic language was introduced, so style transfer accuracy is perfect (1).

FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatically correct, and fully fluent (1). Therefore the joint score, the arithmetic mean of the three sub-scores, is 1.0."
"No one is vandalizing assholes, so get it straight!!!","No one is vandalizing, so get it straight",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit insult ""assholes"" is removed and no new toxic language is introduced, so the sentence is fully neutral (score 1).
CS: Deleting the insult does not alter the factual proposition (that nobody is vandalizing) nor the speaker’s directive ""get it straight""; the core meaning is completely preserved (score 1).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical and easily readable; punctuation and wording pose no comprehension issues (score 1). Therefore, the average joint score is 1.0."
"DUDE CALM THE FUCK DOWN!!!
",DUDE CALM DOWN,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral version removed the explicit profanity ""THE FUCK,"" eliminating all toxic language and leaving a fully neutral expression, so the score is 1. 
CS: Apart from dropping the expletive intensifier, the sentence still conveys exactly the same directive—telling someone to calm down—so the core meaning is fully preserved; score 1. 
FS: ""DUDE CALM DOWN"" is short, grammatical, and easily understood; there are no fluency issues, so the score is 1."
"Some jackass vandalized the article again, can someone fix it?","Someone vandalized the article again, can someone fix it?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element is the insult ""jackass""; it has been removed and replaced with the neutral word ""Someone,"" so the sentence is fully detoxified (score 1). CS: Apart from the removal of the insult, every piece of informational content—vandalism occurred again and a request for help fixing it—remains intact; therefore the original meaning is completely preserved (score 1). FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and easy to read; no fluency issues are present (score 1). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1.0."
I'm afraid I can't verify it as his myspace account has been deleted I fucking hate you.,I'm afraid I can't verify it as his myspace account has been deleted.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The insulting phrase “I fucking hate you” has been completely removed; no toxic or aggressive language remains, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the factual information about being unable to verify the MySpace account, but it drops the speaker’s negative feeling toward the interlocutor (""I ... hate you""). Because part of the original semantic content is lost, Content Similarity is only partially preserved, so CS = 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, coherent, and natural-sounding; hence Fluency = 1.
Joint score is the arithmetic mean of the three sub-scores: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
He deserves every beating and rape he will be subjected to.,He deserves every beating and rape he will be subjected to,0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA): The neutral text keeps the exact toxic wording ('deserves every beating and rape'), so no detoxification has taken place. Score = 0.
Content Similarity (CS): Because the neutral text is identical to the toxic text (minus the final period), the original meaning is fully preserved. Score = 1.
Fluency (FS): The sentence is grammatically correct but lacks a closing period, which is a minor punctuation error. This slightly reduces fluency but it is still easily understandable. Score = 0.5."
