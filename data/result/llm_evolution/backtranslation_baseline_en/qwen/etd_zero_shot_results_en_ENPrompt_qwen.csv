any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,any of us who did half this would be locked up already.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'the fuck' while preserving a completely neutral tone, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning of the original sentence—that people doing half of the described actions would already be imprisoned—remains intact, with only a minor, non-substantive deletion of slang; hence, content similarity is fully preserved (CS = 1). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, showing no fluency issues (FS = 1). All three dimensions are optimally satisfied."
are they liars or just clueless ?,are they liars or just clueless?,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text: 'are they liars or just clueless?'. While the sentence is grammatically correct and fluent (FS = 1) and fully preserves the original meaning (CS = 1), it still contains a derogatory implication by calling people 'liars' and 'clueless', which are accusatory and potentially toxic expressions. Since no effort was made to rephrase or neutralize the toxic content, the Style Transfer Accuracy is 0. The output fails to transform the style into a genuinely neutral tone, thus receiving the lowest score for STA."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .","as someone from la and an oilfield worker, i still say this guy is not",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic expression 'a piece of shit' has been completely removed and replaced with a neutral phrase, resulting in a fully de-toxified statement. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the beginning of the sentence preserves the speaker's identity and perspective (from LA, oilfield worker), the original strong negative judgment is only implied by 'not' without completing the thought, leading to significant information loss. The core sentiment is weakened and the intended contrast or conclusion is unclear. Fluency (FS) is scored 0.5 because the neutral text is grammatically correct but ends abruptly with 'i still say this guy is not', making it an incomplete sentence and affecting readability and natural flow. Overall, the detoxification removes toxicity successfully but at the cost of meaning preservation and fluency."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","calm down, cnn.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text 'calm the fuck down, cnn.' contains a profane expression ('the fuck') that contributes to its aggressive tone. The neutral text 'calm down, cnn.' successfully removes the profanity while maintaining a polite and neutral tone, achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning—urging CNN to calm down—is preserved without any significant alteration or loss of intent, so content similarity is fully maintained (CS = 1). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no fluency issues (FS = 1). All three dimensions receive the highest score, resulting in a joint score of 1."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 0.5 because the neutral text partially removes the toxic content. The original sentence uses the aggressive metaphor 'smack trump around', which conveys hostility and is toxic in tone. This phrase remains unchanged in the output, so the language is not fully neutralized. However, the removal of 'if those ships do anything foolish' slightly reduces the confrontational implication, suggesting partial mitigation. Content Similarity (CS) is 0.5 because while the core idea of China and Russia responding forcefully to U.S. naval actions is implied, the truncation of the conditional clause ('if those ships do anything foolish') results in an incomplete thought and loss of key contextual meaning. The rewritten sentence feels cut off, weakening the logical structure. Fluency (FS) is 0.5 because the neutral text is grammatically correct but ends abruptly, making it feel incomplete and awkward. The sentence lacks proper closure, which affects readability and natural flow, though it remains understandable in context."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,People like this rarely care about facts.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic term 'cretins' is successfully replaced with the neutral term 'People', effectively removing the derogatory language while maintaining a completely neutral tone, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning of the sentence — that individuals of a certain type tend to disregard facts — is preserved without any significant alteration or information loss, warranting a content similarity score of 1. The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, showing no fluency issues, so the fluency score is also 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1.0."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,do people actually believe this?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the offensive word 'shit' and excessive punctuation ('???'), which contribute to its toxic style. The neutral text successfully removes the offensive term by replacing it with a more neutral placeholder (implied by context) and reduces the punctuation to a single question mark, resulting in a completely neutral tone—thus, STA is 1. The core meaning—expressing disbelief about whether people actually believe something—is fully preserved; only the profanity is removed, not the intent—so CS is 1. The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no fluency issues—hence FS is 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","dont you ever change one of my edits, or i will come to your house",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text partially removes the toxic content by deleting the explicit threat 'and i will cut you', which reduces the severity. However, the remaining statement 'i will come to your house' still carries an implicit threat and can be interpreted as intimidating or harassing, so the language is not completely neutral. Therefore, STA is scored 0.5. For Content Similarity (CS), the core meaning of the original warning—defending one's edits and threatening consequences for interference—is largely preserved, albeit with reduced extremity. The key elements (protection of edits and a personal threat) remain, so CS is scored 1. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct, coherent, and easily understandable, with only a minor punctuation issue (missing space after comma), which does not affect readability. Thus, FS is scored 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (0.5 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
even bush knows he fucked up .,even bush knows that he messed up.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully replaces the profane expression 'fucked up' with the milder and more neutral phrase 'messed up', effectively removing the toxic content while maintaining a completely neutral tone, thus earning a Style Transfer Accuracy score of 1.0. The core meaning of the sentence — that Bush acknowledges his mistake — is fully preserved, with only a synonymous substitution that does not alter the intended message, justifying a Content Similarity score of 1.0. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and free of any linguistic errors, resulting in a Fluency score of 1.0. All three dimensions are optimally satisfied, leading to a joint score of 1.0."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,I don't like popeyes for doing this in the first place.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully replaces the profanity 'fuck' with the more neutral expression 'I don't like,' effectively removing the toxic language while maintaining a completely neutral tone, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning—that the speaker holds a negative sentiment toward Popeyes for initiating a certain action—is preserved without any significant alteration or information loss, warranting a content similarity score of 1. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, showing no fluency issues, so the fluency score is also 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1.0."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,getting myself kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic phrase 'getting my ass kicked' has been successfully rewritten as 'getting myself kicked', which removes the vulgar expression and results in a completely neutral tone. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general intent of learning from a difficult experience is preserved, the idiomatic strength and emotional intensity of the original phrase 'getting my ass kicked'—which conveys strong frustration or defeat—are significantly weakened in the neutral version. The core event (failing GRE practice tests leading to a resolution to avoid repetition) is implied, but the vividness and emphasis are partially lost. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, syntactically sound, and fully readable, despite being slightly less natural than the original. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1)/3 = 0.83."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,getting stronger every month yeah i wish.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the profanity 'fucking', which contributes a strong emotional and potentially offensive tone. The neutral text successfully removes this profanity by replacing 'i fucking wish' with 'i wish', resulting in completely neutral language, thus achieving a Style Transfer Accuracy score of 1. The core meaning—that the speaker is expressing a wish about getting stronger every month—is fully preserved, with only the intensifier 'fucking' removed, which does not alter the fundamental message, warranting a Content Similarity score of 1. The neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and free of any linguistic errors, so the Fluency score is also 1. All three dimensions are optimally satisfied."
have you ever been to r trees and seen all the shit people say weed can do ? .,Have you ever been to r trees and seen all the things people say weed can do,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic word 'shit' has been successfully replaced with the neutral term 'things', effectively removing the offensive language while maintaining a completely neutral tone, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning of the sentence — inquiring whether the reader has seen the various claims about weed on r trees — remains intact, with only a non-essential lexical change, so content similarity is fully preserved (CS = 1). The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally, showing no fluency issues (FS = 1). The joint score is therefore the average of three 1s, resulting in 1."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .","Oh my god, a cop got fired?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the expression 'holy shit', which is a profane exclamation. The neutral text replaces it with 'Oh my god', which conveys a similar level of surprise without profanity, thus fully removing the toxic content (STA = 1). The core meaning — expressing shock about a police officer being fired — is fully preserved, with no loss of key information (CS = 1). The neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and clearly understandable (FS = 1). Therefore, all dimensions score perfectly, resulting in a joint score of 1."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,how do you manage that?.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the profanity 'fuck', which contributes to its offensive tone. The neutral text successfully removes this profanity, resulting in a completely neutral and polite expression, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning—expressing surprise or curiosity about how someone manages something—is fully preserved, with only the expletive removed, so content similarity is intact (CS = 1). The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, showing no fluency issues (FS = 1). Therefore, all dimensions score perfectly, resulting in a joint score of 1.0."
how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,how do you think people afford houses and cars?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the expletive 'fuck', which contributes a strong emotional and offensive tone. The neutral text removes this profanity entirely, replacing it with a clean, neutral phrasing while preserving the core question about affordability of houses and cars. Thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0 as the output is fully neutral. Content Similarity is 1.0 because the essential meaning and structure of the question remain unchanged—only the profanity is removed. Fluency is 1.0 as the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1.0."
i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost scared,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic expression 'almost shit my pants' has been replaced with 'almost scared', which removes the vulgar language and results in a completely neutral tone. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general idea of a strong fear reaction is preserved, the specific intensity and idiomatic expression 'shit my pants'—which conveys extreme surprise or fear—is not fully retained. The replacement 'almost scared' is vague and loses the original emphasis, leading to partial meaning loss. Fluency (FS) is 0.5 because the neutral text 'i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost scared' is grammatically incorrect—the phrase 'almost scared' lacks a complement (e.g., 'almost got scared' or 'was almost scared')—making the sentence feel incomplete or awkward, though the overall meaning is still understandable."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,I did not vandalize anything.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text 'I did not vandalize anything.' successfully removes the offensive term 'you dick' from the original toxic text 'i did not vandalize anything you dick.', resulting in a completely neutral statement, thus achieving full Style Transfer Accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning—denying the act of vandalism—is fully preserved without any addition or omission of key information, warranting a Content Similarity score of 1. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no fluency issues, so Fluency is scored 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,I don't care about sides.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'I don't give a flying fuck' and replaces it with the polite and neutral equivalent 'I don't care', achieving complete style transfer to a non-toxic form (STA = 1). The core meaning—indifference toward 'sides'—is fully preserved without any loss of essential information (CS = 1). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, demonstrating high linguistic fluency (FS = 1). All three criteria are fully satisfied, resulting in a joint score of 1.0."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,i have toilet paper to wipe my behind and no shortage of food.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the phrase 'wipe my ass', which is considered vulgar or offensive language. The neutral text replaces 'ass' with 'behind', which is a more polite synonym, effectively removing the toxic content while maintaining complete neutrality. Therefore, Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1. The core meaning of having toilet paper and sufficient food is fully preserved, with only a lexical substitution of a synonymous, less offensive term, so Content Similarity is 1. The neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and fully fluent, warranting a Fluency score of 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1.0."
i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but fucking seriously .,i mean it's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'fucking seriously', which is a clear profanity, resulting in a fully neutral tone; thus, STA is scored 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS), the original sentence expresses both positive sentiment toward the pope and a critical, emphatic interjection ('fucking seriously') that likely conveys skepticism or frustration. While the positive part is preserved, the neutral text abruptly cuts off after 'and awesome and', losing both the concluding thought and the nuanced attitude of the speaker. This partial loss of meaning and truncation leads to a CS score of 0.5. For Fluency (FS), despite the truncation, the remaining sentence is grammatically correct and readable, with no internal errors, so it scores 1.0. The joint score is the average: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","i sell quite a bit of stuff on there, and paypal has actually helped me",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic term 'shit' has been successfully replaced with the neutral term 'stuff', effectively removing the offensive language and rendering the sentence completely neutral in tone. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the first part of the sentence retains the core meaning, the neutral text omits the phrase 'pay the bills' at the end, which is a significant part of the original message regarding PayPal's financial impact. This results in partial, but not complete, preservation of meaning. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any linguistic errors. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1)/3 = 0.83."
"if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the shit out of him .","if hes found to have acted in cold blood, the feds are going to persec",0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 0.5 because the toxic phrase 'persecute the shit out of him' has been partially neutralized by truncating the sentence at 'persec', which removes the explicit vulgarity but does not complete the intended neutral reformulation. However, the neutral text is severely cut off, suggesting an incomplete transformation rather than a proper detoxification. Content Similarity (CS) is 0.0 because the neutral text is incomplete and fails to preserve the core meaning of the original sentence—specifically, the consequence of being prosecuted harshly by the feds. The truncation results in a complete loss of the original message. Fluency (FS) is 0.0 because the neutral text ends abruptly mid-word ('persec'), making it grammatically incorrect and extremely difficult to understand. Overall, the detoxification attempt is unsuccessful due to severe incompleteness."
it s a big deal because the school didn t give a shit until she was being bullied .,it's a big deal because the school didn't care until she was being bullied,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1 because the toxic expression 'didn't give a shit' has been successfully rewritten to 'didn't care', which is a neutral equivalent and completely removes the profane language. Content Similarity is scored 1 because the core meaning—that the school only started paying attention after bullying occurred—is fully preserved; 'didn't care' conveys the same level of neglect as the original phrase without altering the intended message. Fluency is scored 1 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and free of any linguistic errors. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
"judging by the shit i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .","judging by the things i ve seen in my number years, number of those spent",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic word 'shit' has been successfully replaced with the neutral term 'things', and the resulting text contains no offensive or toxic language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the beginning of the sentence retains the original intent of reflecting on experiences over the years, the neutral text is cut off prematurely ('number of those spent') and lacks the full reference to 'George W.', leading to partial loss of core meaning. Fluency (FS) is also scored 0.5 because although the sentence starts fluently, the abrupt truncation makes the ending incomplete and grammatically awkward, reducing overall readability. Despite the smooth replacement of the toxic term, the incompleteness affects both content preservation and fluency."
"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up","last warning you tosser, it takes meminutes to resolve a page so you",0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA): The neutral text removes the most explicit profanity 'fucking' and 'cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up', which is a significant reduction in toxicity. However, the terms 'tosser' and the overall aggressive tone ('last warning') still convey a derogatory and hostile intent, so the detoxification is only partial. Hence, STA = 0.5.

For Content Similarity (CS): The core message — issuing a final warning due to someone's disruptive behavior related to Wikipedia page resolution — is partially preserved. However, the removal of the phrase 'cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up' eliminates a key part of the original intent, which was to accuse the person of actively damaging Wikipedia. This results in meaningful information loss, so CS = 0.5.

For Fluency (FS): The neutral text is mostly understandable but ends abruptly with 'so you', which is an incomplete sentence and appears to be a truncation. This creates a grammatical and structural issue, making the sentence feel unnatural or broken. Despite correct word order in parts, the incompleteness harms readability. Thus, FS = 0.5."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .","liar, liar pants on fire justin.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text: 'liar, liar pants on fire justin.' This phrase, while childish in tone, contains an insult ('liar') and is thus considered toxic. Since no changes were made to remove or mitigate the toxic content, the Style Transfer Accuracy is 0. The Content Similarity is 1 because the meaning is fully preserved—there is no alteration at all. Fluency is 1 because the sentence is grammatically correct and easily understandable, despite its informal and playful nature. However, the lack of any detoxification effort results in a low joint score."
my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,my thoughts are that our new guy might be a even bigger dirt bag.,0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 0 because the neutral text fails to remove the toxic expression 'dirt bag', which is a derogatory term. The word remains unchanged, and thus the language is not neutral. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 1 because the neutral text preserves the exact meaning and structure of the original sentence, with no loss of core information. Fluency (FS) is scored 0.5 because although the sentence is mostly understandable, it contains a grammatical error: 'a even bigger' should be 'an even bigger'. This error affects readability but does not render the sentence incomprehensible."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","no way number bricks fits in a car, this is bs.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the profanity 'fucking' and the expression 'this is bs', which is informal but not severely toxic. The neutral text removes 'fucking' while preserving the emphatic tone through 'no way', which is acceptable in neutral language. The phrase 'this is bs' remains, but in many detoxification frameworks, 'bs' (bullshit) is considered borderline; however, since the primary profanity ('fucking') has been removed and the resulting text does not contain overtly toxic language, the style transfer is considered fully successful (STA=1). The core meaning—that disbelief that number bricks fit in a car and that the situation is unreasonable—is fully preserved (CS=1). The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and readable, with no fluency issues (FS=1). Therefore, all scores are 1, and the joint score is 1.0."
noones asking you to invade shit .,noones asking you to invade.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the profanity 'shit', resulting in a completely neutral expression. The word 'invade' remains, but without the vulgar modifier, the sentence no longer carries toxic language. Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the core idea of 'not asking you to invade' is preserved, the original emphatic and aggressive tone conveyed by 'invade shit' is partially lost. The phrase 'invade shit' likely implies a strong objection to unnecessary aggression, and simplifying it to 'invade' softens the intended emphasis, leading to some meaning loss. Fluency is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, despite the contraction 'noones' (intended as 'no one's') being informal—it does not impede readability or understanding."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,not messing around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the phrase 'not fucking around', which is a profane expression. In the neutral text, this is replaced with 'not messing around', which conveys the same emphasis without the profanity, successfully removing the toxic content (STA: 1). The rest of the sentence remains unchanged, preserving the original meaning about refraining from involvement in foreign matters beyond one's control; thus, the core content is fully retained (CS: 1). The neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and free of any linguistic errors, making it fully fluent (FS: 1). All criteria are fully satisfied, resulting in a joint score of 1.0."
nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady as fuck .,nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the highly toxic expression 'shady as fuck', replacing it implicitly by truncating the sentence, thus eliminating all offensive language and achieving a neutral tone. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core idea about missing footage making the unaccounted time suspicious is implied, the neutral version cuts off the concluding phrase, resulting in an incomplete thought and loss of the original emphasis on suspicion or negative perception. This omission leads to partial, but not complete, preservation of meaning. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct and readable, despite being an incomplete sentence; it does not contain any grammatical errors or awkward constructions that impair understanding. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
number will solve alot of fucking problems if it comes down to it .,number will solve alot of problems if it comes down to it.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1 because the neutral text successfully removes the profanity 'fucking', resulting in a completely neutral expression. Content Similarity is 1 because the core meaning—that a number will solve many problems if necessary—is fully preserved; only the intensifier 'fucking' is removed, which does not alter the essential message. Fluency is scored 0.5 because the neutral text contains a spelling error: 'alot' should be 'a lot'. This is a minor grammatical issue that does not impede understanding but affects language quality. Thus, the joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random shit like this .,org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random things like this.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text uses the word 'shit', which is a profane expression and considered toxic. The neutral text replaces 'shit' with 'things', which is a neutral and appropriate term, effectively removing the toxic content while maintaining complete neutrality—thus, STA is 1. The core meaning of the sentence is preserved: both versions convey that Wikipedia has articles on various random topics; the substitution does not alter the intended message, so CS is 1. The neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and free of any linguistic errors, so FS is 1. All dimensions score perfectly, resulting in a joint score of 1.0."
"ouch man , them swedes were dicks to norway =\","Oh man, those swedes were not good to Norway.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'dicks' and replaces it with the non-offensive phrase 'not good to', resulting in a completely neutral tone (STA = 1). The core meaning—that the Swedes treated Norway poorly—is preserved without any significant loss of information (CS = 1). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no fluency issues (FS = 1). Therefore, all dimensions receive the highest score."
people are idiots for wasting emergency call time on crap like this .,people are not wise for wasting emergency call time on stuff like this.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'idiots' and replaces it with the more neutral 'not wise,' resulting in a completely non-toxic and respectful tone. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 1 because the core meaning—that people are making poor choices by misusing emergency call time on trivial matters—is fully preserved; 'crap' is replaced with 'stuff like this,' which is a mild but semantically similar term, and 'not wise' conveys a similar evaluative judgment as 'idiots' without the offensiveness. Fluency (FS) is scored 1 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any syntactic or lexical issues. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
"quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some idiot hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .","quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some bad hierarch, even unto being",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic term 'idiot' has been successfully replaced with the more neutral term 'bad', effectively removing the offensive language and rendering the sentence stylistically neutral. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core idea—that saints were canonized for opposing a negative figure, even to the point of death—is preserved, the truncation of the sentence ('even unto being' without completion) results in loss of full contextual meaning and reference (e.g., the mention of a specific saint is cut off). Fluency (FS) is also scored 0.5 because although the sentence is mostly grammatically correct, the abrupt ending makes it incomplete and slightly awkward to read, reducing overall readability. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.6667."

The neutral text successfully removes this profanity while retaining the imperative structure and core message, resulting in a completely neutral expression—thus, STA is scored 1. The meaning of the original sentence—urging someone to read a link they provided—is fully preserved without any addition or omission of key information, so CS is 1. The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no fluency issues, warranting an FS score of 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1.0."

The neutral text replaces 'crap' with 'thing', which is a neutral and non-offensive term, effectively removing the toxic content while maintaining a completely neutral tone—thus, STA is scored 1. The core meaning of the sentence—referring to a similar situation occurring in the PNW—remains unchanged; only the evaluative word is substituted, so CS is 1. The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no fluency issues, warranting an FS score of 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
"shit , i d love an number pm sunset .",I love an number pm sunset.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic word 'shit' has been successfully removed from the neutral text, resulting in completely non-toxic and neutral language, thus achieving a Style Transfer Accuracy score of 1. The core meaning of the original sentence — expressing a desire or love for 'an number pm sunset' (despite the original phrasing being somewhat unclear or possibly erroneous) — is preserved without significant alteration, warranting a Content Similarity score of 1. The neutral text 'I love an number pm sunset.' is grammatically acceptable and readable, despite the odd phrase 'an number', which appears to be a typo or grammatical error in the original that was retained; however, this does not severely impact fluency, and the sentence remains understandable and structurally sound, justifying a Fluency score of 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped in the ass .,Some guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 0.5 because while the neutral text removes the highly offensive phrase 'in the ass', replacing it with the less explicit 'get raped', the expression 'get raped' in a prison context still carries strong offensive and dehumanizing connotations, and does not fully achieve a neutral tone. The core toxic implication remains, though it is somewhat softened. Content Similarity is 1 because the rewritten sentence preserves the key events and causal implication: a person robbing a liquor store, being sent to prison, and facing sexual violence. No core information is lost. Fluency is 1 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, syntactically sound, and fully readable. The joint score is the average of the three: (0.5 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.833."
"someone says no , and they say fuck off we need vets only for free housing ? .","someone says no, and they say we need vets only for free housing?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic expression 'fuck off' has been completely removed and replaced with a neutral continuation of the sentence, resulting in language that is entirely free of toxicity. Content Similarity (CS) is 1.0 because the core meaning—that someone objects ('says no') and is met with a strong assertion that only veterans should get free housing—remains fully preserved; the removal of 'fuck off' does not alter the essential message. Fluency (FS) is 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clearly punctuated, and fully readable, with no syntactic or expressive issues. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,still standing up for your lying leader who loves himself and nobody else.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text successfully removes the highly toxic term 'crazy', which carries a derogatory and stigmatizing connotation, especially when applied to individuals. The remaining language, while critical (e.g., 'lying', 'loves himself and nobody else'), does not cross into overtly toxic or abusive territory, making the output sufficiently neutral. Thus, STA is scored 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS), the removal of 'crazy' alters the original sentiment and intensity of the criticism. While the core idea of unwavering support for a self-centered, dishonest leader is preserved, the characterization of the leader is softened, leading to partial meaning preservation. Hence, CS is scored 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct, coherent, and clearly expressed, with no structural or syntactic issues. Therefore, FS is scored 1.0. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
sucked like nothings ever sucked before .,Sucked like never before.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA): The neutral text successfully removes the explicit and exaggerated toxic expression 'sucked like nothings ever sucked before' and replaces it with a milder, more neutral version 'Sucked like never before.' While 'sucked' still carries a negative connotation, it is no longer phrased in a vulgar or hyperbolic manner, thus achieving full detoxification. Therefore, STA is scored 1. For Content Similarity (CS): The core idea of extreme negativity is partially preserved, but the original phrase uses emphatic repetition ('sucked...sucked') for intensification, which is lost in the rewritten version. Additionally, 'nothings ever sucked before' is a grammatically incorrect but expressive intensifier, while 'never before' is more standard but less emphatic. This results in some loss of intensity and nuance, warranting a CS score of 0.5. For Fluency (FS): The neutral text is grammatically correct, concise, and easily understandable. There are no syntactic errors or awkward expressions, so FS is scored 1. The joint score is the average: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."

Content Similarity is scored 1 because the core meaning—that the event in question rarely occurs, except in certain negatively characterized countries—is preserved without significant alteration or information loss. Fluency is scored 0.5 due to the grammatical error 'excepts rarely', which should be 'except rarely' (incorrect verb form on 'excepts'); this error affects readability and language quality, though the sentence remains understandable. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."

Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the beginning of the sentence preserves the original meaning (cheap items with poor quality), the neutral text is cut off mid-sentence ('getting the') and fails to complete the intended comparison with the more expensive alternative, resulting in significant information loss. Fluency (FS) is also scored 0.5 because although the beginning of the sentence is grammatically correct and understandable, the abrupt truncation makes the full output incomplete and disrupts readability. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.6667."

For Content Similarity (CS), the core idea of criticizing how people are being treated is preserved, but the removal of 'like morons' loses the specific manner of treatment described in the original, leading to partial meaning loss; hence, CS is scored 0.5. For Fluency (FS), both the toxic and neutral texts contain the same spelling error 'tratening' (likely meant to be 'treating') and lack proper grammar ('need stop'), making the sentence awkward and non-idiomatic; however, it remains minimally understandable, so FS is scored 0.5."

Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the general idea of negative evaluation is preserved, the original phrase 'fucked up' conveys a stronger sense of psychological or behavioral dysfunction or chaos, which is not fully captured by 'failed'—thus, there is some loss of nuance and intensity in meaning. Fluency is scored 1 because the neutral sentence 'they re both failed' is grammatically correct and readable, despite the contraction 'they re' being informally written; however, it is still understandable and fluent in casual language use."

The resulting text is neutral and free of toxic expressions, warranting a score of 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS): The core idea that the person is lacking in business acumen and forward-thinking is preserved. However, the original phrase 'total sellout' carries a strong connotation of betrayal or lack of integrity, which is not fully captured in the neutral version. This results in partial meaning loss, justifying a score of 0.5. For Fluency (FS): The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and readable, with no structural or syntactic issues, so it receives a score of 1.0. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1)/3 = 0.83."

The resulting text is completely neutral in style. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general intent of questioning someone's understanding of a joke is preserved, the replacement of 'retards' with 'naive' changes the intensity and nuance of the original statement. 'Retards' is a strong insult related to intelligence, whereas 'naive' suggests lack of experience or gullibility, which is a different concept, leading to partial but not complete preservation of meaning. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally: 'This is a joke, are you all naive?' is a fluent and well-structured sentence with no linguistic errors."

Randi was born a DICK.,Randi was born a bad person.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic term 'DICK', which is a vulgar and offensive insult, has been successfully replaced with the neutral phrase 'bad person', resulting in a completely non-toxic and neutral expression. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general negative sentiment about Randi is preserved, the original metaphorical or emphatic nature of calling someone a 'DICK' (which conveys strong disapproval or contempt) is not fully captured by 'bad person', leading to some loss of nuance and intensity. The core idea that Randi is being negatively judged at birth is partially preserved, but the specific connotation is weakened. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence 'Randi was born a bad person' is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding in English.

Therefore, STA is scored 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS), while the core sentiment of disappointment or frustration is preserved, the original phrase 'being an ass' carries a stronger connotation of rude or irresponsible behavior, which is not fully captured by 'being bad'.

These people are INSANE.,These people are INSANE.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text: 'These people are INSANE.'

Fluency (FS) is 1 because the sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural in expression.

Be careful who you call a moron.,Be careful who you call.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic term 'moron', which is a derogatory insult, and replaces it with a more neutral expression by omitting the offensive word entirely. The resulting sentence uses only neutral language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general cautionary intent ('be careful who you call') is preserved, the specific target of the original statement—calling someone a 'moron'—is a key part of the original meaning. This omission results in a loss of specificity and emotional intensity, leading to partial but not complete preservation of meaning. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding in English. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1)/3 = 0.83."
"Yeah, you can fuck off incel.","Yeah, you can go away incel.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the offensive phrase 'fuck off', which is a clear expression of hostility and vulgarity.

Therefore, the Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0 as all toxic content has been successfully removed and the language is fully neutral. The term 'incel' is retained, which is a factual descriptor in this context and not inherently profane, so its preservation does not affect neutrality. Regarding Content Similarity, the core meaning—that the speaker wants the addressed person to leave—is preserved without distortion or loss of key information, warranting a score of 1.0. The neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and free of any linguistic errors, so Fluency is also scored 1.0. All dimensions meet the highest standard."

Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the core action of 'defending pedophiles' is preserved, the original utterance includes a direct personal attack ('faggot') that contributes to the speaker's intent and emotional emphasis; removing it alters the full communicative intent, leading to partial but not complete preservation of meaning.

The phrase 'No one is vandalizing' is non-offensive and appropriate. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core idea of correcting a misconception about vandalism is preserved, the removal of 'assholes' eliminates a key referent from the original sentence, which may have been central to the speaker's intended message or emphasis.
