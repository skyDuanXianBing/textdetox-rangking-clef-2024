any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,Any of us who did half this would be locked up already.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the profanity ('the fuck') while preserving the original meaning and tone of the sentence. The phrase 'did half this shit' is replaced with 'did half this', which is a natural and contextually appropriate way to de-toxify the sentence without losing intent. The core message — that people would be imprisoned for doing half of the actions being discussed — remains intact, satisfying Content Similarity. The resulting sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally, meeting Fluency criteria. Therefore, all three dimensions receive a score of 1."
are they liars or just clueless ?,Are they just clueless?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic implication by eliminating the accusatory term 'liars', resulting in a completely neutral tone. The phrase 'Are they just clueless?' does not contain any offensive or toxic language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the neutral text preserves part of the original meaning (questioning someone's awareness or competence), it omits the stronger accusation of dishonesty ('liars'), which was a core component of the original rhetorical question. This results in a partial loss of meaning. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding in English. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .","as someone from la and an oilfield worker, i still say this guy is not",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic phrase 'a piece of shit' has been completely removed and replaced with a neutral expression ('not'), resulting in a fully de-toxified statement with no remaining offensive language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general sentiment of disapproval is implied, the neutral text is cut off and fails to complete the thought (e.g., 'this guy is not [what?]'), leading to significant loss of the original meaning and intent. Fluency (FS) is scored 0.5 because the sentence is grammatically correct up to the point of truncation, but the abrupt ending makes the expression incomplete and awkward, reducing readability and naturalness. The neutral text appears to be an incomplete rewrite, likely due to a generation error, which impacts both content preservation and fluency."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","Calm down, cnn.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text 'calm the fuck down , cnn .' contains a profane expression ('the fuck') which contributes to its aggressive tone. The neutral text 'Calm down, cnn.' successfully removes the profanity and renders the sentence in a completely neutral and polite tone, achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning—urging CNN to calm down—is preserved without any loss of intent or key information, so content similarity is fully maintained (CS = 1). The neutral text is grammatically correct, properly punctuated, and clearly expressed, demonstrating high fluency (FS = 1). All three dimensions score perfectly, resulting in a joint score of 1.0."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,china and russia will use a big stick to  trump around if those ships,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes overtly toxic language such as 'smack Trump around', which carries aggressive and disrespectful connotations. However, Content Similarity (CS) is 0 because the neutral text is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence ('if those ships'), resulting in a complete loss of the original conditional meaning involving the ships' actions and consequences. Core information about the response to 'foolish' actions by ships is entirely missing. Fluency (FS) is 0 because the neutral text is grammatically incomplete and incoherent, ending abruptly without a verb or object after 'trump around if those ships', making it difficult to understand. Overall, while toxicity is reduced, the output fails in preserving meaning and readability."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,People like this rarely care about facts.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic term 'cretins' is successfully replaced with the neutral term 'People', effectively removing the derogatory language while maintaining a completely neutral tone, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning—that individuals of a certain type tend to disregard facts—is preserved without any significant alteration or information loss, warranting a content similarity score of 1. The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no fluency issues, resulting in a fluency score of 1. All three dimensions are optimally satisfied."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,Do people actually believe this?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the offensive word 'shit' and excessive punctuation ('???'), which contribute to a harsh and emotionally charged tone. The neutral text successfully replaces 'shit' with the more neutral 'this' and reduces the punctuation to a single question mark, resulting in a completely neutral and polite expression—thus earning a Style Transfer Accuracy score of 1.0. The core meaning—expressing skepticism about whether people truly believe something—is fully preserved, with only the offensive language removed, so Content Similarity is also 1.0. The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no fluency issues, warranting a Fluency score of 1.0. All three dimensions are fully satisfied, leading to a joint score of 1.0."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","dont you ever change one of my edits, or i will come to your house",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 0.5 because the neutral text removes the explicit threat 'i will cut you', which is highly toxic, but retains the threatening tone with 'i will come to your house', which still implies intimidation and could be considered a form of verbal threat. Thus, toxic content is partially removed but not fully neutralized. Content Similarity is scored 1 because the core meaning—that the speaker is strongly opposed to their edits being changed and is issuing a serious warning—is preserved; the intent and context remain intact despite the removal of the most extreme phrase. Fluency is scored 1 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clearly structured, and fully readable without any language errors. The joint score is the average of the three: (0.5 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
even bush knows he fucked up .,Even Bush knows that he made a mistake.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully replaces the profane expression 'fucked up' with the neutral and appropriate phrase 'made a mistake', fully eliminating the toxic content, thus achieving a score of 1 for Style Transfer Accuracy. The core meaning—that Bush acknowledges his error—is preserved without any significant alteration or information loss, warranting a Content Similarity score of 1. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no fluency issues, resulting in a Fluency score of 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,I don't like popeyes for doing this in the first place.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully replaces the profanity 'fuck' with the more neutral expression 'I don't like,' effectively removing the toxic language while maintaining a completely neutral tone, thus achieving a Style Transfer Accuracy score of 1. The core meaning—that the speaker holds a negative sentiment toward Popeyes for a specific action—is fully preserved, so Content Similarity is scored 1. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, warranting a Fluency score of 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,getting myself kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic phrase 'getting my ass kicked' has been successfully rewritten as 'getting myself kicked', which removes the vulgar expression and results in a completely neutral tone. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general idea of experiencing difficulty with GRE practice tests is preserved, the idiomatic intensity and emotional connotation of 'getting my ass kicked'—which implies a strong, humiliating defeat—are significantly weakened in 'getting myself kicked', leading to a partial loss of the original expressive meaning. Fluency (FS) is 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, syntactically sound, and fully readable, despite the slightly awkward but acceptable phrasing of 'getting myself kicked'."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,getting stronger every month yeah i wish.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the expletive 'fucking', which contributes a strong emotional and potentially offensive tone. The neutral text removes 'fucking' and replaces it with a clean 'i wish', effectively eliminating the toxic language while maintaining a neutral tone, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning—that the speaker is expressing skepticism or doubt about getting stronger every month—remains intact, as the intensifier 'fucking' is removed but the underlying sentiment of disbelief is still implied through context, so content similarity is fully preserved (CS = 1). The neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and free of any linguistic errors, resulting in perfect fluency (FS = 1). The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
have you ever been to r trees and seen all the shit people say weed can do ? .,Have you ever been to r trees and seen all the things people say  can do,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic word 'shit' has been successfully removed and replaced with the neutral term 'things', resulting in completely non-toxic and neutral language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general structure and intent of the sentence are preserved, the phrase 'weed can do' in the original is altered to 'can do' in the neutral version, where 'weed' is omitted, leading to a loss of core information about what is being discussed. This omission reduces the fidelity to the original meaning. Fluency (FS) is scored 0.5 because the neutral text is understandable but contains an awkward expression: 'seen all the things people say can do' lacks a clear subject between 'say' and 'can do', creating a grammatical gap that affects readability and natural flow, though the sentence remains comprehensible in context."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .",A police officer got fired?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the expletive 'holy shit', which is a clear expression of surprise with emotionally charged, informal language. The neutral text successfully removes this toxic expression and replaces it with a neutral tone by rephrasing the utterance as 'A police officer got fired?', which is a grammatically correct and stylistically neutral question. Thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 as all toxic content is removed and the language is fully neutral. Content Similarity is also 1.0 because the core meaning — surprise or emphasis regarding a police officer being fired — is preserved, despite the removal of the expletive; the key event (a cop being fired) remains intact. Fluency is 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and fully readable. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,How do you manage that?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the expletive 'fuck', which contributes to a harsh tone. The neutral text removes this profanity entirely, replacing it with a grammatically correct and polite version 'How do you manage that?', thus achieving complete detoxification (STA = 1). The core meaning—expressing surprise or curiosity about someone's ability to accomplish something—is fully preserved without any addition or omission of key information (CS = 1). The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no fluency issues (FS = 1). Therefore, all dimensions score perfectly, resulting in a joint score of 1."
how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,How do you think people afford houses and cars?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the expletive 'fuck', which contributes to a harsh and offensive tone. The neutral text removes this profanity entirely, replacing it with a clean version of the same question, thus achieving complete style transfer to a neutral tone (STA = 1). The core meaning—questioning the affordability of houses and cars—remains fully intact, with no loss of information or intent (CS = 1). The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, showing no fluency issues (FS = 1). Therefore, all dimensions score perfectly, resulting in a joint score of 1.0."
i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,I accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost panicked.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully replaces the toxic expression 'almost shit my pants' with the non-toxic and contextually appropriate phrase 'almost panicked,' fully removing the offensive language while maintaining a neutral tone, thus achieving a Style Transfer Accuracy score of 1. The core meaning—that the speaker had a strong, startled reaction due to a misreading—is preserved without any significant information loss, warranting a Content Similarity score of 1. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no fluency issues, justifying a Fluency score of 1. The joint score is therefore the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,I did not vandalize anything.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text 'I did not vandalize anything.' successfully removes the offensive term 'you dick' from the original toxic text 'i did not vandalize anything you dick.', resulting in completely neutral language, thus earning a Style Transfer Accuracy score of 1.0. The core meaning—that the speaker denies having vandalized anything—is fully preserved, with only the insulting addendum removed, so Content Similarity is also 1.0. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, achieving full fluency with no errors, warranting a Fluency score of 1.0. All three dimensions are optimally satisfied."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,I don't care about sides!,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the strong profanity 'I don't give a flying fuck,' which is a clear expression of disregard with offensive language. The neutral text replaces this with 'I don't care,' which conveys the same attitude in a completely neutral and non-toxic manner, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning—indifference toward 'sides'—is fully preserved without any addition or omission of key information, so content similarity is also fully maintained (CS = 1). The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, concise, and natural-sounding in English, with no fluency issues (FS = 1). All three dimensions are optimal, resulting in a joint score of 1.0."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,i have toilet paper to wipe my behind and no shortage of food.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the phrase 'wipe my ass', which is considered vulgar or offensive language. The neutral text replaces 'ass' with 'behind', a more polite and socially acceptable synonym, effectively removing the toxic content while maintaining complete neutrality. Therefore, Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1. The core meaning of the sentence — having toilet paper and sufficient food — is fully preserved; only a single word is substituted with a synonymous term, so Content Similarity is 1. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and free of any linguistic errors, warranting a Fluency score of 1. All three dimensions receive the highest score, resulting in a joint score of 1.0."
i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but fucking seriously .,i mean it's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'fucking seriously', which is profane and emotionally charged, resulting in completely neutral language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the beginning of the sentence preserves the positive sentiment toward the pope being 'cool' and 'awesome', the abrupt cutoff at the end ('and awesome and') results in an incomplete thought and loss of the original contrastive or critical nuance implied by 'but fucking seriously'. This omission alters the intended meaning, suggesting partial but not complete preservation. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct and readable, despite being incomplete—it flows naturally and contains no syntactic errors. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1)/3 = 0.83."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","I sell quite a bit of stuff on there, and paypal has actually helped me",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic term 'shit' has been successfully replaced with the neutral term 'stuff', and the rest of the language is non-toxic and appropriate. The rewriting effectively eliminates the offensive expression while maintaining the general context of selling items online. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because although the first part of the sentence retains the original meaning, the neutral text is cut off at 'helped me', omitting the original completion 'pay the bills'. This results in partial loss of the core message regarding PayPal's role in financial support. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and readable, with no noticeable language errors. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1)/3 = 0.83."
"if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the shit out of him .","if hes found to have acted in cold blood, the feds are going to c",0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 0.5 because while the toxic phrase 'persecute the shit out of him' is being modified, the neutral text is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence ('the feds are going to c'), so it's unclear whether the replacement is fully neutral. The original toxic expression is partially removed but not properly replaced, resulting in an ambiguous outcome. Content Similarity (CS) is 0 because the neutral text is incomplete and fails to convey any coherent continuation of the original meaning—core information is entirely lost due to truncation. Fluency (FS) is 0 because the neutral text is grammatically incomplete and cannot be understood as a valid sentence; it breaks off mid-word, making it impossible to interpret. As a result, all dimensions are severely impacted by the incompleteness of the neutral text."
it s a big deal because the school didn t give a shit until she was being bullied .,it's a big deal because the school didn't care until she was being bullied,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully replaces the toxic expression 'didn't give a shit' with the more neutral 'didn't care', which conveys the same sentiment without profanity, thus achieving complete style transfer to a neutral tone (STA = 1). The core meaning—that the school only took action after the bullying had already started—is fully preserved, with no loss of key information (CS = 1). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, showing no fluency issues (FS = 1). Therefore, all dimensions score perfectly, resulting in a joint score of 1."
"judging by the shit i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .","judging by the things i ve seen in my number years, number of those spent",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic word 'shit' has been successfully replaced with the neutral term 'things', and the resulting text contains no offensive or toxic language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the beginning of the sentence retains the original intent, the neutral text is cut off prematurely ('number of those spent') and lacks the full reference to 'George W.', leading to partial loss of core meaning. Fluency (FS) is also scored 0.5 because although the sentence starts fluently, the abrupt ending makes it feel incomplete and disrupts readability, suggesting a grammatical or structural issue despite the initial portion being understandable."
"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up","last warning you, it takes meminutes to resolve a page so people like you",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes all toxic language such as 'fucking tosser' and 'cunts like you', replacing them with neutral terms like 'you' and 'people like you'. The resulting text is completely free of offensive expressions and maintains a neutral tone. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general intent of issuing a warning and criticizing someone's disruptive behavior is preserved, key nuances are lost. The original strong emotional emphasis and the specific claim about how quickly pages can be resolved are weakened or made vague (e.g., 'meminutes' is unclear and likely a typo, but it's retained in both versions). Additionally, the replacement of highly charged terms with neutral ones results in a significant softening of the speaker's attitude, which affects the communicative impact. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, syntactically sound, and readable despite the unusual word 'meminutes'—which appears in both versions and does not impede overall comprehension. The sentence structure is intact and natural. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1)/3 = 0.83."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .",liar is on fire justin,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA): The toxic phrase 'liar, liar pants on fire' is a well-known taunt, and while the neutral text changes it to 'liar is on fire', the core insult remains. The expression is slightly softened but still carries a derogatory tone, so the detoxification is only partial, warranting a 0.5. For Content Similarity (CS): The original phrase uses a rhyming childish insult, while the rewritten version simplifies it and loses the idiomatic expression 'pants on fire', which is a key part of the original meaning. Some meaning is preserved (the accusation of lying), but the cultural and expressive nuance is lost, resulting in a 0.5. For Fluency (FS): The neutral text 'liar is on fire justin' is grammatically awkward—it lacks proper punctuation and article usage, and the phrase 'liar is on fire' is semantically unclear (literal vs. metaphorical). However, it is still minimally understandable, so a 0.5 is appropriate. The joint score is the average of the three: (0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.5."
my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,My thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger unpleasant person.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully replaces the toxic expression 'dirt bag' with the more neutral and appropriate term 'unpleasant person,' effectively removing the offensive language while maintaining a completely neutral tone, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning of the original sentence—that the speaker suspects the new person may have negative personal qualities—is preserved without any significant alteration or information loss, so content similarity is fully maintained (CS = 1). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no issues in readability or expression, warranting a fluency score of 1. All three dimensions are optimally satisfied, resulting in a joint score of 1.0."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","no way number bricks fits in a car, this is bs.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic word 'fucking' has been successfully removed, resulting in a completely neutral expression ('no way') without introducing any new toxicity. The revised sentence uses standard language and contains no offensive or inflammatory terms. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 1.0 because the core meaning — disbelief that number bricks fit in a car and calling it 'bs' — is fully preserved. The removal of 'fucking' does not alter the essential message or intent. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and fully readable. There are no syntactic errors or awkward expressions. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
noones asking you to invade shit .,noones asking you to invade.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the profanity 'shit', resulting in a completely non-toxic and neutral expression. Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the core idea of 'no one is asking you to invade' is preserved, the original emphasis or emotional intensity conveyed by the word 'shit' is lost, which may have been part of the speaker's intended meaning (e.g., frustration or sarcasm), leading to partial information loss. Fluency is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,not interfering in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully replaces the toxic expression 'fucking around' with the more neutral and appropriate 'interfering,' which conveys a similar action without the offensive language. This results in a completely neutral tone, earning a full score for Style Transfer Accuracy. The core meaning of not getting involved in foreign matters beyond one's control is fully preserved, so Content Similarity is also scored as 1. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, satisfying the highest fluency standard. Therefore, all three dimensions receive a score of 1, leading to a joint score of 1.0."
nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady as fuck .,nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the highly toxic expression 'shady as fuck', replacing it implicitly by truncating the sentence, resulting in completely neutral language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core idea about missing footage making the unaccounted time suspicious is implied, the explicit judgment (i.e., that it 'looks shady') is removed, leading to partial loss of meaning. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct and readable, though it ends abruptly; however, it remains a complete and understandable sentence. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1)/3 = 0.83."
number will solve alot of fucking problems if it comes down to it .,number will solve alot of problems if it comes down to it.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1 because the neutral text successfully removes the profanity 'fucking', resulting in a completely neutral expression. Content Similarity is 1 because the core meaning—that a number will solve many problems if needed—is fully preserved; only a single intensifying modifier is removed, which does not alter the essential message. Fluency is scored 0.5 because while the sentence is mostly understandable, it contains a spelling error: 'alot' should be 'a lot'. This minor grammatical issue affects language quality but does not impede comprehension."

In the neutral text, it is replaced with 'things', a completely neutral and appropriate term, effectively removing the toxic content while maintaining a natural tone—thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0.

"quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some idiot hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .","quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some hierarch, even unto being killed",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the derogatory term 'idiot' to describe a religious hierarch, which constitutes a mild form of personal insult and thus represents toxic content. The neutral text successfully removes this by omitting the word 'idiot', resulting in a completely neutral description of the hierarch, hence achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning—that saints were canonized for opposing a hierarch, even to the point of death—is fully preserved without any significant information loss, so content similarity is complete (CS = 1).

some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped in the ass .,Some r guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the explicit and toxic phrase 'get raped in the ass', replacing it with an incomplete but non-toxic continuation. The most offensive content has been eliminated, and what remains does not express toxicity. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the beginning of the sentence (the robbery of a liquor store for $400) is preserved, the neutral text is cut off mid-sentence ('goes to prison to get'), resulting in a significant loss of the original consequence or outcome, which was a core part of the meaning. The intent to convey a harsh or ironic punishment is partially lost. Fluency (FS) is scored 0.5 because the neutral text is grammatically correct up to the point of truncation but ends abruptly and incompletely, making it syntactically and semantically incomplete. While readable, it lacks closure and proper sentence structure, reducing overall fluency."

The core meaning—that someone objects ('says no') and is met with a statement about needing veterans only for free housing—is fully preserved without any addition or omission of key information, so content similarity is complete (CS = 1). The neutral text is grammatically correct, clearly punctuated, and reads naturally, showing no fluency issues (FS = 1). All three dimensions are optimally satisfied, resulting in a joint score of 1."
still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,still standing up for your lying leader who loves himself and nobody else.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the highly toxic and offensive term 'crazy', which carries a derogatory connotation, resulting in a more neutral expression. The remaining content ('lying leader who loves himself and nobody else') is critical but does not contain overtly toxic or abusive language, thus meeting the criteria for complete detoxification. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core idea of criticizing a self-centered leader is preserved, the removal of 'crazy' alters the intensity and characterization of the original statement. The term 'crazy' was a key part of the original sentiment and its removal results in a noticeable reduction in emotional charge and personal attack, leading to partial meaning preservation. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any linguistic errors. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1)/3 = 0.83."
sucked like nothings ever sucked before .,Sucked like nothings ever worse before,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes any explicitly toxic or offensive language. The original phrase 'sucked like nothings ever sucked before' uses strong negative language, and the rewritten version replaces the second 'sucked' with 'worse', which mitigates repetition and slightly softens the tone, making it more neutral. However, the word 'sucked' remains, which is informal and negative, but not overtly toxic, so the overall style is considered neutral under the given criteria. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general sentiment of extreme negativity is preserved, the core expression is altered in a way that changes meaning: 'sucked like nothing ever worse before' is semantically unclear and does not carry the same comparative force as the original. The intended hyperbolic criticism is partially lost due to awkward phrasing. Fluency (FS) is scored 0.5 because the neutral text 'Sucked like nothings ever worse before' contains grammatical issues: 'nothings' should be 'nothing', and 'worse before' is an unnatural and syntactically incorrect replacement for 'sucked before'. The sentence is understandable in intent but has clear expression and grammatical flaws."
taking a stand with either party is equally retarded .,Taking a stand with either party is equally .,1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic word 'retarded' has been completely removed, and the resulting text does not contain any offensive or toxic language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.0 because the neutral text ends abruptly as 'Taking a stand with either party is equally .' and fails to convey the original judgment or meaning—the core opinion is lost due to the incomplete sentence. Fluency (FS) is scored 0.5 because while the beginning of the sentence is grammatically correct, the sentence is incomplete and ends with a period after 'equally', making it awkward and syntactically flawed. Overall, the output is understandable in part but suffers from serious content truncation and structural issues."

The resulting text uses completely neutral language, so STA is scored 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS), while the general idea that something rarely happens is preserved, the original text specifically emphasized extremely poor or unstable countries through the derogatory term 'shit hole countries'. This nuance is lost in the neutral version, leading to partial meaning loss, so CS is scored 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text contains a grammatical error: 'excepts rarely' should be 'except rarely' (using 'excepts' as a verb is incorrect in this context). This error affects readability, but the sentence is still mostly understandable, so FS is scored 0.5."

Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the beginning of the neutral text preserves the original meaning (cheap items with poor quality), the sentence is cut off at the end ('getting the'), resulting in a loss of the core information about opting for a more expensive alternative. This incompleteness leads to partial preservation of meaning. Fluency (FS) is also scored 0.5 because although the portion that is present is grammatically correct and understandable, the abrupt ending makes the sentence incomplete and disrupts readability. The neutral text fails to form a complete thought, indicating a significant expression issue."
they need stop tratening people like morons .,They need to stop treating people badly.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text successfully removes the toxic content. The original phrase 'tratening people like morons' (intended as 'treating people like morons') carries a demeaning and insulting tone, which is effectively neutralized in the rewritten version 'treating people badly,' resulting in a fully neutral expression. Thus, STA = 1. For Content Similarity (CS), while the core idea of unfair or disrespectful treatment is preserved, the specific implication of being treated as unintelligent (i.e., 'like morons') is generalized to 'badly,' which loses some nuance and specificity. This constitutes a partial preservation of meaning, so CS = 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral sentence 'They need to stop treating people badly.' is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, despite the original toxic sentence containing a spelling error ('tratening'). The corrected version is fluent and well-formed, so FS = 1. The joint score is the average: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
they re both fucked up .,They're both failed.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic language ('fucked up') and replaces it with a non-toxic expression ('failed'), resulting in a completely neutral tone. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general idea of something being wrong or not working is preserved, the original phrase 'both fucked up' implies a deeper level of dysfunction or emotional/psychological issues, whereas 'both failed' is more limited in scope and may not fully capture the intended meaning. There is some loss of nuance and intensity. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence 'They're both failed' is grammatically correct and readable, despite being somewhat minimal. However, 'failed' as a predicate adjective is slightly awkward without additional context (e.g., 'They're both failed attempts'), but still understandable and structurally sound."

The resulting text contains no offensive or toxic language, fulfilling the goal of detoxification. Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the core idea of criticizing the person's business acumen and lack of forward thinking is preserved, the original text emphasized a stronger judgment (e.g., 'total sellout', 'no brains') which carried a more specific connotation about betrayal or lack of integrity; this nuance is lost in the neutral version, resulting in partial information loss. Fluency is scored 1 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and readable, with no structural or linguistic issues. The sentence flows naturally and is well-formed."
"this is a joke , are you all fucking retards ? .","This is a joke, are you all naive?",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic language: the offensive phrase 'fucking retards' is replaced with the non-offensive term 'naive', resulting in a completely neutral tone. Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the general intent of questioning the audience's reaction to a joke is preserved, the replacement of 'retards' with 'naive' changes the original meaning to some extent—'retards' implies a derogatory judgment about intelligence, whereas 'naive' suggests lack of experience, which is a different nuance. Thus, there is partial but not complete preservation of core meaning. Fluency is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
this is some twilight zone shit,this is some twilight zone stuff,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the word 'shit', which is a mild profanity and contributes to the overall informal and potentially offensive tone. In the neutral text, it is replaced with 'stuff', which is a completely neutral and non-offensive synonym. This change successfully removes the toxic content while preserving the original meaning and tone of expressing something unusual or strange (referring to 'twilight zone'). Therefore, Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1. The core meaning—expressing that something feels surreal or bizarre—is fully retained, so Content Similarity is 1. The neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and free of any linguistic errors, so Fluency is also 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."

Fluency (FS) is 1 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."

The core meaning—asking for the title of a report—remains unchanged, so Content Similarity is 1.0. The neutral text is grammatically correct, concise, and natural-sounding, so Fluency is also 1.0.

The core meaning—questioning why Syria is widely disliked—is preserved exactly, with no addition or omission of key information, so Content Similarity is 1.0.

The revised sentence no longer contains any offensive or vulgar language, fulfilling the goal of style transfer to a neutral tone. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general idea about offshore accounts and accountants remains, the original phrase 'comparitively fuck all' likely intended to emphasize that very little is paid or contributed in comparison, possibly in a critical or sarcastic tone. The replacement 'comparitively not all' is semantically unclear and weakens the intended contrast or criticism, leading to partial loss of the original meaning. Fluency (FS) is scored 0.5 because the neutral text ends abruptly with 'and', making it syntactically incomplete. The sentence structure is awkward and lacks proper closure, though the overall meaning is still somewhat understandable. The grammatical issue reduces fluency but does not render it completely incomprehensible."

Randi was born a DICK.,Randi was born a bad person.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic term 'DICK', which is a vulgar and offensive insult, has been successfully replaced with the neutral phrase 'bad person', resulting in a completely non-toxic and neutral expression. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general negative sentiment about Randi is preserved, the original metaphorical or emphatic insult 'born a DICK' carries a stronger connotation related to behavior and attitude, possibly implying arrogance or malice from birth, which is not fully captured by the vague term 'bad person'. Thus, some nuance and intensity of the original meaning are lost. Fluency (FS) is 1.0 because the neutral sentence 'Randi was born a bad person.' is grammatically correct, syntactically sound, and easily understandable with no language errors."

Fluency is 1.0 as the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and readable, with only a minor capitalization inconsistency ('WAHT' corrected to 'what') that does not affect overall fluency. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."

The resulting text contains no toxic language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.0 because the neutral text 'Stop defending .' is incomplete and fails to preserve the core meaning of the original sentence, which was an accusation related to defending pedophiles and included a personal attack. The key informational content is lost, leaving only a fragment. Fluency (FS) is scored 0.5 because while the remaining fragment is grammatically simple and understandable, it is syntactically incomplete due to the missing object after 'defending', making it awkward and unnatural. Overall, the detoxification removed toxicity successfully but at the cost of meaning and completeness."

He deserves every beating and rape he will be subjected to.,He deserves every beating and  he will be subjected to.,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text removes the explicit mention of 'rape', which is a toxic element, but retains 'every beating', which still promotes violence and can be considered toxic. Therefore, the detoxification is only partial, resulting in a score of 0.5. For Content Similarity (CS), the core idea of the person deserving harm is partially preserved, but the removal of 'rape' alters the severity and nature of the original intent, leading to some meaning loss—hence a score of 0.5.

This results in a fluency score of 0.5."
