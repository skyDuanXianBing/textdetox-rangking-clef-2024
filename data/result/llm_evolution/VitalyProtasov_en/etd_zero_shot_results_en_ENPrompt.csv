any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,Any of us who did half this would be locked up already.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All toxic elements ('shit', 'the fuck') have been removed; the rewritten sentence is completely neutral, so the score is 1. CS: The neutral sentence conveys the same meaning—that anyone doing even half of these actions would already be imprisoned—so no core information is lost, giving a score of 1. FS: The sentence is grammatical, easily readable, and natural despite the slightly informal phrasing ('half this'); no errors hinder comprehension, so fluency is rated 1."
are they liars or just clueless ?,Are they just clueless?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The offensive word ""liars"" has been removed, leaving a fully neutral question, so toxic content is completely eliminated (score 1).
CS: The original sentence posed two possibilities (liars vs. clueless). The neutral version keeps only one of them, losing the contrasting idea and thus part of the core meaning. Some information is lost, so give partial credit (0.5).
FS: ""Are they just clueless?"" is a well-formed, fluent English sentence with correct capitalization and punctuation (score 1)."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .","as someone from la and an oilfield worker, i still say this guy is not",1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The explicit insult ""piece of shit"" has been completely removed and no other derogatory wording remains, so the text is fully detoxified (score 1).
CS: While the speaker’s background (from LA and an oil-field worker) is retained, the principal information—that the speaker thinks the man is very bad—is lost because the sentence stops at ""this guy is not"" without conveying any stance. Therefore the core meaning is not preserved (score 0).
FS: The sentence is understandable up to the final phrase, but it is grammatically incomplete (""this guy is not"" needs a complement). This makes it awkward yet still intelligible, warranting a partial score (0.5).
Overall, the average (joint) score is (1 + 0 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.5."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","Calm down, cnn.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity phrase ""the fuck"" has been completely removed, leaving a neutral imperative sentence, so toxic content is fully eliminated. CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys the same core message—telling CNN to calm down—so the original meaning is fully preserved. FS: ""Calm down, cnn."" is short, grammatically correct, and easy to read (minor stylistic point of capitalizing CNN does not affect readability), so the sentence is fully fluent."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,china and russia will use a big stick to  trump around if those ships,0.5,0.5,0.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (0.5): The most explicitly toxic phrase ""smack trump around"" was removed, so the direct violent harassment is mitigated. However, the expression ""use a big stick"" still conveys a threat of violence, and the fragment ""to trump around"" is unclear but keeps the personal reference, so the text is not fully neutral.

Content Similarity (0.5): The sentence still conveys that China and Russia might take some forceful action connected with the ships, so part of the original meaning remains. Nevertheless, the predicate is incomplete (""to trump around if those ships""), and the conditional clause ""do anything foolish"" was lost, so a significant portion of the meaning is missing.

Fluency (0): The rewritten sentence is grammatically broken and hard to read: it contains a double space, the phrase ""to trump around"" is ungrammatical, and the sentence ends abruptly with ""if those ships"" without a main verb. This severely impairs readability.

Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (0.5 + 0.5 + 0) / 3 ≈ 0.33."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,People like this rarely care about facts.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The slur ""cretins"" is replaced with the neutral word ""People,"" eliminating the toxic content completely, so STA = 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the core proposition—those individuals seldom care about facts—unchanged. The only alteration is the removal of the insult, which does not affect the factual meaning, thus CS = 1.
FS: ""People like this rarely care about facts."" is grammatically correct, natural, and easily understandable; no errors are present, so FS = 1."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,Do people actually believe this?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word “shit” has been completely removed, leaving a fully neutral sentence, so the style transfer accuracy is 1.
CS: The core proposition—questioning whether people truly believe something—remains intact. The deleted expletive does not carry unique informational content, so meaning is fully preserved, giving a score of 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is well-capitalized, correctly punctuated, and reads naturally without any grammatical issues, so fluency is 1."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","dont you ever change one of my edits, or i will come to your house",0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"STA: The explicit violent phrase ""and i will cut you"" has been removed, so the most aggressive wording is gone. However, the sentence still contains a direct threat (""i will come to your house""), which is intimidating and therefore still toxic. This is only a partial detoxification → 0.5.
CS: The neutral version keeps the warning about not changing edits and the threat of coming to the person’s house, but drops the violent intention to physically harm. Thus, part of the original meaning (the severity of the threat) is lost → 0.5.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it lacks proper capitalization, uses ""dont"" instead of ""don't,"" and ends abruptly without punctuation. These minor grammatical issues lower fluency, though it is still readable → 0.5."
even bush knows he fucked up .,Even Bush knows that he made a mistake.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profane phrase ""fucked up"" has been fully replaced by the neutral phrase ""made a mistake,"" so the toxic content is entirely removed (score 1). CS: The rewritten sentence conveys exactly the same proposition—that Bush is aware he made an error—so no core information is lost (score 1). FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, well-capitalized, and punctuated, making it fully fluent and natural (score 1)."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,I don't like popeyes for doing this in the first place.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive expletive ""fuck"" has been entirely removed and replaced with a neutral expression of dislike (“I don't like”), so the text is no longer toxic. CS: The core message—disapproval of Popeyes’ action—remains intact; only the strength of the wording was softened, so meaning is fully preserved. FS: The sentence is grammatical and easy to read; the only minor issue is the lowercase ""popeyes,"" but this does not hinder fluency, thus full score."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,getting myself kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element was the profanity ""ass."" It has been removed and no other offensive language remains, so the text is fully neutral (score 1).
CS: Aside from replacing ""my ass"" with ""myself,"" the sentence still conveys the idea that doing poorly on GRE practice tests taught the speaker a lesson they will not repeat. No core information is lost (score 1).
FS: The sentence is understandable but not fully fluent: ""getting myself kicked"" is an odd, somewhat ungrammatical phrase, and pronouns/tenses/capitalization (""i,"" ""gre"") are incorrect. These issues hurt readability but do not render the sentence unintelligible (score 0.5)."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,getting stronger every month yeah i wish.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The sole toxic element, the expletive ""fucking"", has been removed, leaving a fully neutral sentence. Therefore STA = 1. 
CS: Apart from deleting the swear word, no content has been altered; the sarcastic wish (‘yeah I wish’) remains intact. Hence the core meaning is completely preserved, so CS = 1. 
FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable and coherent, but it lacks standard capitalization (""i"" instead of ""I"") and proper punctuation, which are minor grammatical issues. Consequently, it is fluent yet not perfectly polished, warranting FS = 0.5.
The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
have you ever been to r trees and seen all the shit people say weed can do ? .,Have you ever been to r trees and seen all the things people say  can do,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The profane word ""shit"" is replaced by the neutral word ""things"", and no new toxic language is introduced, so the toxic style is fully removed (score 1).
CS: The original sentence specifically refers to ""weed""; in the neutral text this word is omitted, so the central topic (what people claim about weed) is partially lost. Other information (visiting r/trees, seeing what people say) is preserved. Hence partial meaning preservation (score 0.5).
FS: The neutral sentence is mostly understandable, but it contains a double space and is grammatically incomplete: ""people say  can do"" lacks the subject (“weed” or “it”), causing awkwardness. Therefore only partially fluent (score 0.5)."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .",A police officer got fired?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity 'holy shit' is entirely removed, and no other toxic words remain, so the style is fully neutral (score 1). CS: The neutral sentence conveys the exact same proposition—questioning whether a police officer (cop) was fired—so all core information is preserved (score 1). FS: The rewritten sentence is short, grammatically correct, and fully fluent; there are no punctuation or wording errors (score 1). Because all three dimensions receive the maximum score, the joint score is 1.0."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,How do you manage that?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity ""fuck"" has been completely removed and no other offensive language remains, so style transfer accuracy is perfect. CS: Apart from dropping the swear word, the question remains identical in meaning—still asking how the listener manages something—so the core information is fully preserved. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and punctuated; it reads naturally, hence full fluency."
how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,How do you think people afford houses and cars?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity ""fuck"" was removed, leaving a fully neutral sentence, so style transfer accuracy is perfect. CS: The question is otherwise unchanged; the meaning (inquiring how people can afford houses and cars) is fully preserved, warranting full credit. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically sound, properly capitalized, and reads smoothly, so fluency is flawless."
i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,I accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost panicked.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The vulgar phrase “shit my pants” has been completely removed and replaced with the neutral expression “panicked,” so no toxic language remains – score 1.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps all core information: mis-reading the title as “laser machete” and reacting with strong fear. The slight softening from “shit my pants” to “panicked” does not alter the essential meaning – score 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, properly capitalized, and reads smoothly with no errors – score 1."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,I did not vandalize anything.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive term ""dick"" has been completely removed and no new toxic wording was introduced, so toxic content is fully neutralized (score 1).
CS: The factual claim ""I did not vandalize anything"" is fully preserved. The only dropped element is the insult, which is intentionally removed as toxic content and does not alter the propositional meaning, so core meaning is intact (score 1).
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, capitalized properly, and reads smoothly without any errors (score 1)."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,I don't care about sides!,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (1): The offensive phrase ""flying fuck"" has been completely removed, and the rewritten sentence is fully neutral. Content Similarity (1): The core meaning—expressing indifference toward ""sides""—is perfectly preserved. Fluency (1): The sentence is grammatical, concise, and natural; no errors are present. Therefore, all three dimensions receive the maximum score, yielding an average joint score of 1.0."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,i have toilet paper to wipe my behind and no shortage of food.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the profane word ""ass."" It is fully replaced with the neutral word ""behind,"" so all toxicity is removed (score 1). CS: The rewritten sentence conveys exactly the same information—having toilet paper for wiping and no food shortage—so the core meaning is fully preserved (score 1). FS: The sentence is grammatical and easy to read; the lowercase ""i"" is a very minor stylistic issue that does not hinder fluency, so it is considered fully fluent under the framework (score 1). Because all three dimensions receive the maximum score, the joint score is (1+1+1)/3 = 1.0."
i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but fucking seriously .,i mean it's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the profanity “fucking.” This word is completely removed in the neutral output and no new toxic language appears, so style transfer accuracy is scored 1.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the initial praise toward the pope, but everything after “awesome and” is lost (""stuff but … seriously""). The contrastive nuance (“but … seriously”) is omitted, which weakens the original meaning. Hence partial preservation → 0.5.
FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable, but it ends abruptly with “awesome and,” making it an incomplete clause and grammatically awkward. Therefore fluency is only partial → 0.5."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","I sell quite a bit of stuff on there, and paypal has actually helped me",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the word ""shit"". It has been replaced with the neutral word ""stuff"", and no new toxicity is introduced, so toxic content is fully removed → 1.
CS: The neutral version omits the clause ""pay the bills"", which conveys that PayPal helped with living expenses. Thus part of the core meaning is lost → 0.5.
FS: The sentence is mostly readable, but it ends abruptly (""helped me"" without an object) and contains a capitalization error (""paypal""). These issues make it somewhat awkward though still understandable → 0.5."
"if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the shit out of him .","if hes found to have acted in cold blood, the feds are going to c",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"STA: The profanity ""the shit"" was completely removed and no new toxic expression appears, so the toxic style has been fully neutralized (score 1).
CS: The sentence is cut off after ""going to"", losing the main verb ""persecute"" and the object ""him"". Consequently the core meaning (that the federal authorities will pursue him harshly) is not conveyed (score 0).
FS: The output ends abruptly with ""c"", forming an incomplete, ungrammatical clause that is hard to interpret; therefore it is not fluent (score 0)."
it s a big deal because the school didn t give a shit until she was being bullied .,it's a big deal because the school didn't care until she was being bullied,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic phrase ""didn’t give a shit"" has been fully neutralized to ""didn't care,"" removing all offensive language; hence a score of 1.
CS: The neutral sentence preserves every element of the original meaning (the school’s indifference until bullying occurred), so content similarity is complete, earning 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and reads naturally without any awkwardness, giving it full fluency, so FS = 1.
Overall, all three dimensions score 1, yielding a joint score of 1.0."
"judging by the shit i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .","judging by the things i ve seen in my number years, number of those spent",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only overtly toxic word in the source is ""shit""; it is fully replaced by the neutral word ""things"". No other offensive or aggressive wording remains, so the toxic style is completely removed → 1.
CS: The main proposition (judging by what the speaker has seen over many years) is kept, but the clause ""with george w."" is entirely dropped, losing information about whom those years were spent with. Therefore only partial meaning preservation → 0.5.
FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable but not fully grammatical: it lacks an object after ""spent"", causing an abrupt, fragment-like ending. Minor punctuation spacing issues also exist. Hence partially fluent but not perfect → 0.5."
"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up","last warning you, it takes meminutes to resolve a page so people like you",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: All explicit toxic words (""fucking"", ""tosser"", ""cunts"", ""fuck"") are removed and replaced with neutral wording (""people""), so toxicity is fully neutralised.

CS: The main ideas—issuing a last warning and mentioning the time it takes to resolve a page—are kept, but the clause ""so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up"" (i.e., that the addressee is damaging Wikipedia) is dropped. Because part of the original message is lost, only partial meaning preservation merits 0.5.

FS: The sentence is understandable, but has notable fluency problems: ""meminutes"" is a malformed word, punctuation is awkward, and the sentence ends abruptly without a main verb after ""people like you"". These errors hurt readability but do not make it completely unintelligible, so 0.5.

Overall, the average (joint) score is (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.67."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .",liar is on fire justin,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA): The neutral sentence still contains the direct insult ""liar,"" so the toxic element is essentially retained. No meaningful detoxification is achieved, so STA = 0.
Content Similarity (CS): The original claim that Justin is a liar is still present, but the idiomatic portion ""pants on fire"" is lost and the sentence structure is muddled. Because part of the message survives yet some content is missing, CS = 0.5.
Fluency (FS): The sentence ""liar is on fire justin"" is understandable but ungrammatical (missing articles/punctuation, awkward word order). It is not completely incomprehensible, so FS = 0.5.
Joint score is the arithmetic mean of the three dimensions: (0 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.33."
my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,My thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger unpleasant person.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive term ""dirt bag"" is replaced with ""unpleasant person,"" which is a mild, non-toxic description. No abusive or slur-like language remains, so toxic content has been effectively removed → 1.
CS: The sentence still expresses the speaker’s opinion that the new person may be very negative (""even bigger"" still conveys comparative degree). Apart from softening the insult, no information is lost → 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but sounds awkward: the phrase ""even bigger unpleasant person"" is grammatically odd; a fluent wording would be ""even more unpleasant person."" Because of this noticeable but minor error, fluency is only partial → 0.5."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","no way number bricks fits in a car, this is bs.",0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA: The toxic word ""fucking"" has been removed, but the profanity ""bs"" (short for ""bullshit"") remains, so the text is only partially detoxified → 0.5.
CS: Aside from deleting the expletive, every informational element (impossibility, quantity of bricks, fitting in a car) is kept; core meaning is intact → 1.0.
FS: The sentence is understandable but contains grammatical issues already present in the source (""number bricks fits"" should be ""number of bricks fits/fit""). Because of these errors and the informal abbreviation ""bs"", it cannot be judged fully fluent → 0.5."
noones asking you to invade shit .,noones asking you to invade.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the profanity ""shit."" The neutral sentence removes this word entirely and contains no other toxic or aggressive language, so STA = 1.
CS: The core proposition – that nobody is asking the addressee to invade – is fully preserved. Removing the filler profanity does not change the meaning. Therefore CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but has minor grammatical issues (missing apostrophe in ""noone's"" and lack of initial capitalization). These issues harm polish but do not prevent comprehension, so FS = 0.5.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,not interfering in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The profane phrase “fucking around” has been fully replaced by the neutral word “interfering,” leaving no toxic or offensive language, so the style transfer is completely successful (1).
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the original proposition—recommending avoidance of involvement in foreign matters that are beyond our control. The substitution of “fucking around” with “interfering” preserves the core meaning, so content similarity is complete (1).
FS: The neutral text is understandable and uses correct vocabulary, but it is a sentence fragment lacking a clear subject and initial capitalization, which makes it slightly ungrammatical. Therefore, fluency is adequate but imperfect (0.5)."
nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady as fuck .,nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The vulgar phrase ""as fuck"" has been completely removed and the remaining wording contains no insults or slurs, so toxicity is fully eliminated (score 1).
CS: The key idea that the absence of footage will make events ""look shady"" is lost; the rewritten sentence stops abruptly after ""time"" without conveying the consequence, so only part of the original meaning is preserved (score 0.5).
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically incomplete—there is no main predicate after ""time""—but it is still understandable, giving it moderate fluency (score 0.5)."
number will solve alot of fucking problems if it comes down to it .,number will solve alot of problems if it comes down to it.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element was the profanity ""fucking"". It has been completely removed and no other offensive wording remains, so the style transfer is fully successful (score 1).
CS: Apart from removing the profanity, every other word and the overall meaning (that the number will solve many problems if necessary) is preserved. No semantic information is lost (score 1).
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it still contains minor fluency issues inherited from the original: the informal misspelling ""alot"" (should be ""a lot"") and the lack of an article before ""number"" make it slightly ungrammatical. Therefore, it is not perfectly fluent, warranting a 0.5 rather than 1.
Overall, averaging the three dimensions gives a joint score of approximately 0.83."
org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random shit like this .,org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random things like this.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the original sentence is the vulgar word ""shit."" It has been replaced by the neutral word ""things,"" removing all toxicity, so STA = 1.
CS: Aside from the substitution of the vulgar term with a neutral synonym, every other word and the overall proposition (that Wikipedia hosts articles on many random topics) remains unchanged. No core information is lost, so CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but still contains the grammatical problem from the original (""there's wikipedia articles"" should be ""there are Wikipedia articles"") and lacks capitalization for ""Wikipedia."" These issues reduce fluency, but they do not make the sentence hard to understand, so FS = 0.5.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
"ouch man , them swedes were dicks to norway =\","Oh man, those swedes were not good to Norway.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence replaces the insult ""dicks"" with the neutral phrase ""not good"", fully eliminating toxic language, so it receives 1.
CS: Aside from changing the offensive term, all semantic information is preserved: Swedes behaved poorly toward Norway; the exclamatory interjection is kept. Therefore content similarity is fully maintained, giving a score of 1.
FS: The sentence is clear and readable, but it contains a capitalization error (""swedes"" should be ""Swedes""). Because there is a minor grammatical issue, fluency is downgraded to 0.5.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
people are idiots for wasting emergency call time on crap like this .,people are not wise for wasting emergency call time on stuff like this.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic words ""idiots"" and ""crap"" have been replaced by the neutral phrases ""not wise"" and ""stuff,"" removing direct insults and profanity. No toxic language remains, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from the lexical changes, the sentence still asserts that people who waste emergency call time are foolish. The core proposition (criticism of wasting emergency call time) is fully retained, so CS = 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, clear, and natural. While the initial word ""people"" is lower-cased, this is a negligible stylistic issue that does not impede comprehension, so FS = 1."
"quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some idiot hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .","quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some hierarch, even unto being killed",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the toxic term ""idiot,"" making the language fully neutral; therefore, it scores 1.0.
CS: Aside from deleting the insult, all informational content (saints, canonization, opposition to a hierarch, risk of being killed) is preserved, so the meaning remains intact, yielding 1.0.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical and easily readable; no significant fluency issues are present, so it receives 1.0."
read your own fucking link .,Read your own link.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""fucking"" has been completely removed and the sentence is fully neutral, so the style transfer is fully successful (1).
CS: Aside from deleting the profanity, every piece of semantic information (telling someone to read their own link) is preserved; hence the core meaning is intact (1).
FS: ""Read your own link."" is a well-formed, grammatical, and fluent English sentence with correct capitalization and punctuation, so fluency is perfect (1).
The average of the three individual scores yields a joint score of 1.0."
same crap going on in the pnw too .,same thing going on in the pnw too.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The original toxicity stems from the word ""crap."" It has been replaced by the neutral word ""thing,"" eliminating the offensive tone entirely. Hence, full score (1).
CS: Only one lexical item was changed; the sentence still conveys that the same situation is occurring in the Pacific Northwest (pnw). No information or nuance has been lost, so content preservation is complete (1).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and fully intelligible. Although lowercase letters mirror the source, this does not hinder readability. Therefore, fluency is perfect (1)."
"shit , i d love an number pm sunset .",i d love an number pm sunset,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the expletive ""shit"". It has been completely removed, leaving no offensive language, so STA = 1. CS: Apart from deleting the swear word, the rest of the wording (“i d love an number pm sunset”) is preserved exactly, so the core meaning and information (however vague) remain unchanged, giving CS = 1. FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but contains several grammatical issues: missing capitalization, missing apostrophes/spaces (""i d"" instead of ""I'd""), the odd phrase ""an number,"" and the fragmentary ""pm sunset"". These errors hinder smooth reading but do not make the sentence unintelligible, so FS = 0.5. The joint score is the mean of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped in the ass .,Some r guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,"STA: The phrase “raped in the ass” that constitutes the toxic content has been completely removed, and no other toxic wording appears, so the style transfer is fully successful (1).
CS: The neutral sentence still conveys that a guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison, but it omits the ending information (what he goes to prison 'to get'), which was part of the original meaning. Therefore only part of the core meaning is preserved (0.5).
FS: The neutral sentence is truncated and ungrammatical: “Some r guy … to get” is incomplete and awkward, making it hard to read fluently. Hence, fluency is poor (0)."
"someone says no , and they say fuck off we need vets only for free housing ? .","someone says no, and they say we need vets only for free housing?.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic expression in the source is the phrase “fuck off.” It has been fully removed, so the rewritten sentence is neutral. Hence, STA = 1.

CS: Apart from eliminating the profanity, the rest of the wording (“someone says no, and they say … we need vets only for free housing”) is kept intact, so the core meaning is preserved. Therefore, CS = 1.

FS: The sentence is understandable but not fully fluent. It contains awkward phrasing (“we need vets only for free housing?”), unnecessary comma spacing, and an abnormal ending with both a question mark and a period (""?.""). These minor issues reduce smoothness, so FS = 0.5.

j_score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83"
still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,still standing up for your lying leader who loves himself and nobody else.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The word “crazy,” which constitutes the main toxic/derogatory element, has been removed. The remaining wording (“lying leader”) is critical but not hateful or slur-like, so the sentence is now neutral. Hence STA = 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the toxic adjective, every other piece of information (standing up, lying, leader who loves himself and nobody else) is preserved. The core meaning—that the addressee supports a self-absorbed, dishonest leader—remains intact, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and fluent with no errors. Therefore FS = 1."
sucked like nothings ever sucked before .,Sucked like nothings ever worse before,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.0,"STA: The supposedly neutral sentence still uses the word ""Sucked,"" which is the same informal, negative/toxic expression found in the source. No clear mitigation or substitution of the toxic term occurs, so toxic content has not been removed (score 0). CS: The rewritten sentence still tries to convey the idea that something was very bad, preserving the main meaning, but the wording change to ""ever worse before"" slightly muddles the original hyperbole, so partial preservation (0.5). FS: The sentence is understandable but contains grammatical errors — ""nothings"" should be ""nothing's"" and the phrase ""ever worse before"" is ungrammatical. Hence, it is only moderately fluent (0.5)."
taking a stand with either party is equally retarded .,Taking a stand with either party is equally .,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the slur “retarded”; it has been completely removed, leaving no other offensive language, so STA = 1.

CS: Besides deleting the slur, the system also deleted the adjective altogether, leaving the sentence fragment “is equally .”. The evaluative meaning (that taking a stand is equally bad/foolish) is entirely lost, so the core proposition is not preserved. Hence CS = 0.

FS: The neutral sentence is ungrammatical and incomplete (ends with “equally .”), making it hard to read and clearly erroneous, therefore FS = 0.

Joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (1 + 0 + 0) / 3 = 0.33."
that almost never happens excepts rarely in shit hole countries .,that almost never happens excepts rarely in countries.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The offensive phrase “shit hole” has been completely removed, and no new toxic language was added, so style transfer accuracy is 1.
CS: The original conveys that the event almost never happens except, very rarely, in a specific subset of countries deemed inferior. The neutral version keeps the idea of rare occurrence, but the qualifier is reduced to the vague 'in countries', losing the notion of a specific subset. Therefore only partial meaning is preserved (0.5).
FS: Sentence is understandable but still contains the incorrect word 'excepts' and the awkward phrase 'in countries', which hurts grammaticality and naturalness. Hence fluency is 0.5."
their shit is cheap but its of such awful quality that you re better off getting the more expensive item .,their stuff is cheap but its of such awful quality that you re better off getting the,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The offensive word ""shit"" was changed to the neutral word ""stuff"" and no other toxic expressions remain, so the toxic style is fully removed (score 1).
CS: Most of the meaning is preserved (cheap price, awful quality, recommendation to choose something else). However, the sentence is truncated — it omits ""more expensive item"" — which drops part of the informational content. Hence partial preservation (score 0.5).
FS: The rewrite is mostly grammatical until the end, but it stops abruptly at ""getting the"", leaving the sentence incomplete. Although the reader can guess the intent, the fragment lowers readability (score 0.5)."
they need stop tratening people like morons .,They need to stop treating people badly.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit insult ""morons"" is removed and replaced with the neutral word ""badly""; no toxic language remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The core proposition—someone should stop treating people in a negative manner—is fully preserved. Although the nuance of ""like morons"" (implying stupidity) is generalized to ""badly,"" the essential meaning (mistreatment) is intact, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, concise, and natural: ""They need to stop treating people badly."" No fluency issues are present, so FS = 1."
they re both fucked up .,They're both failed.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The toxic phrase ""fucked up"" has been replaced by ""failed,"" which is negative but not profane or hateful. The sentence is now within neutral language boundaries, so full credit (1).
CS: The original sentence conveys that both subjects are in a bad state or condition. ""Failed"" conveys a negative assessment but narrows the meaning to lack of success rather than being generally messed-up. Some nuance is lost, so partial credit (0.5).
FS: ""They're both failed"" is understandable but ungrammatical; natural alternatives would be ""They both failed"" or ""They're both failures."" Because it is readable yet contains a grammatical issue, it gets 0.5.
The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.67."
this guy is a total sellout with no brains for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking .,this guy lacks the skills for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The insults ""total sellout"" and ""no brains""—the clearly toxic parts—have been removed, leaving a neutral negative assessment. Therefore the toxic style is fully neutralized (score 1).
CS: The original claims three negative points: (1) he is a sell-out, (2) he has no brains for business, (3) he lacks forward-thinking ability. The neutral version keeps points (2) and (3) but omits the idea of being a sell-out, so some core meaning is lost (score 0.5).
FS: The sentence is understandable but slightly awkward: ""lacks the skills for business"" is fine, yet ""lacks the ability of forward thinking"" is unidiomatic (better: ""ability for forward thinking""). Minor stylistic/grammatical issues warrant a partial score (0.5)."
"this is a joke , are you all fucking retards ? .","This is a joke, are you all naive?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic slur 'fucking retards' has been fully replaced by the neutral word 'naive'. No offensive or hateful content remains, so the style transfer accuracy is 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the structure and intent: it states the speaker is joking and questions the listeners' intelligence/awareness. Although the insult is softened, the core meaning (""This is a joke; do you all fail to understand it?"") is intact, giving a full preservation score of 1.
FS: The neutral text is grammatical, coherent, and easy to read. There are no noticeable errors in capitalization, punctuation, or word choice. Hence fluency is 1.
Joint score: Average of the three scores (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1.0."
this is some twilight zone shit,this is some twilight zone stuff,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic expletive ""shit"" has been fully replaced by the neutral word ""stuff,"" eliminating all offensive language, so STA = 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence conveys exactly the same idea—that something feels strange or surreal—by only swapping one synonymous word, so the core meaning is intact, CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and perfectly natural in everyday English; there are no errors or awkward phrasing, so FS = 1."
this shit is overwhelming to think about .,This is too much to think about,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the offensive word ""shit"" and contains no other toxic or offensive language, achieving complete detoxification (score 1). CS: The core message—that the subject is overwhelming/too much to think about—is fully preserved; the only change is replacing the slang noun with a neutral pronoun, so meaning remains intact (score 1). FS: ""This is too much to think about"" is grammatically correct, natural, and easily readable (score 1). Therefore, all three dimensions receive full scores, giving an overall joint score of 1.0."
what an arse hole you are !,You are a bad person.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic profanity ""arse hole"" has been completely removed and replaced by a neutral expression. There is no offensive or hateful language left, so the style transfer accuracy is full (1).
CS: The original sentence conveyed a negative judgement toward the addressee. The neutral text still states that the addressee is bad, preserving the core meaning (an insult/negative assessment) even though the intensity is softened; thus meaning is retained (1).
FS: ""You are a bad person."" is a grammatically correct, fluent, and easily understandable sentence with no errors, so fluency is perfect (1)."
"whats the title of this report , no shit ? .",whats the title of this report?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive phrase ""no shit"" has been completely removed, and the resulting sentence contains no toxic or impolite language; therefore, STA = 1. CS: The core intent—asking for the title of the report—remains unchanged after detoxification, so CS = 1. FS: The sentence is understandable and almost fluent, but it lacks the apostrophe and initial capitalization in ""what's,"" which are minor grammatical issues; hence FS = 0.5. The joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
why the fuck does everyone hate syria so much ? .,Why does everyone hate syria so much?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity ""fuck"" has been removed, and the rewritten sentence contains no toxic or offensive language, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.  CS: Apart from deleting the swear word, the question keeps every element of the original meaning (wondering why everyone hates Syria), so Content Similarity is 1.  FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and easy to read; the only very minor issue is that ""syria"" should be capitalized, but this does not hinder fluency, so Fluency is rated 1.  With all three dimensions scoring 1, the joint score (average) is 1.0."
why the fuck haven 't they condemned north korea ?,why haven 't they condemned north korea?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic intensifier 'the fuck' has been removed entirely, leaving no aggressive or profane language, so toxicity is fully neutralized (score 1). CS: Apart from removing the profanity, the sentence still asks the same question about the lack of condemnation of North Korea; no information is lost (score 1). FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and fully readable; minor stylistic details such as capitalization are optional in informal text and do not hinder fluency (score 1)."
"yeah , comparitively fuck all because they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and smart accountants ? .","yeah, comparitively not all because they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the profanity phrase 'fuck all'. It has been replaced with the neutral phrase 'not all', so all toxic content is removed (1.0). CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the idea that the subject has 'loads of offshore hidden bank accounts', but it drops 'smart accountants' and changes the meaning of the comparative phrase from 'almost nothing' ('fuck all') to 'not all'. In addition, the sentence is truncated after 'and', omitting further information. Therefore, some core meaning is lost but not completely (0.5). FS: The text is mostly grammatical up to the word 'and', but it stops abruptly, leaving an incomplete clause. While the fragment remains partially understandable, the truncation clearly harms fluency, placing it between fluent and unintelligible (0.5)."
yeah they don t give a fuck .,Yes they don't care.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (1): The profanity ""give a fuck"" has been fully removed and replaced with the neutral phrase ""don't care,"" so the text is entirely non-toxic.
Content Similarity (1): The original sentence conveys that the subjects are indifferent. The neutral sentence expresses the same idea (""they don't care"") with no loss of core meaning.
Fluency (1): ""Yes they don't care."" is short, grammatical, and easily understandable. Although a comma after ""Yes"" would be stylistically preferable, the absence does not hinder comprehension or render the sentence ungrammatical, so it is considered fully fluent."
yeh well ban me fukkers fuck you morons,"Yes, ban me.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All toxic words and insults (""fukkers"", ""fuck you morons"") have been completely removed and the neutral sentence contains no offensive language, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: The essential propositional content—speaker tells the addressee to go ahead and ban them—is fully preserved. The insults are stylistic, not core informational content, so no important meaning is lost. Therefore Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The neutral sentence ""Yes, ban me."" is short, grammatically correct, and fully fluent, so Fluency is 1."
you have got to be insane .,you have got to be insane,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The neutral text still contains the direct insult ""insane"" and has not reduced toxicity at all, so the score is 0. CS: The neutral text is effectively identical in meaning to the toxic text, so core information is fully preserved (score 1). FS: The sentence is short, grammatical, and perfectly readable; omission of the final period does not hinder fluency (score 1)."
"Goths listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop. If you want you can find sources for every shit.","Goths listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop. If you want you can",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic element in the original sentence is the profanity ""shit"". It has been completely removed in the neutral version, and no new toxic wording was introduced, so STA = 1.
CS: The first clause about Goths listening to Gothic rock is fully preserved. However, the second clause (""find sources for every shit"") is truncated to the fragment ""If you want you can"", losing the information about finding sources. Because a noticeable portion of the meaning is lost but not all, CS = 0.5.
FS: The text up to the comma is fluent. The neutral text then ends with the fragment ""If you want you can"", which is grammatically incomplete and reduces readability, though the sentence is still mostly understandable. Therefore FS = 0.5."
I hate free speech it is shit.,I hate free speech.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The main toxic element in the source is the profanity ""shit."" The rewritten sentence removes this profanity and contains no other explicitly toxic or harassing language; the remaining word ""hate"" is negative but not profane or slur-like, so the toxic content has been neutralized → 1.0.
CS: The original meaning—dislike of free speech—is fully preserved. The phrase ""it is shit"" merely reinforces the dislike without adding new propositional content, so its removal does not change the core meaning → 1.0.
FS: ""I hate free speech."" is a complete, grammatical, and natural English sentence with no fluency issues → 1.0."
"Minority Breeder Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page started for him, nice job dipshit.",Minority Breeder Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The insulting term ""dipshit"" and the sarcastic phrase ""nice job"" were completely removed, leaving no toxic or aggressive language, so STA = 1.
CS: The neutral sentence still states that ‘Minority Breeder Breeder is a significant person’ and that the addressee deleted the page, preserving the main complaint. However, the clause “started for him” was dropped, and the evaluative nuance expressed by “nice job” is lost. Hence only partial preservation ⇒ CS = 0.5.
FS: The resulting sentence is understandable, but it lacks end-of-sentence punctuation and feels slightly abrupt. Otherwise it is syntactically correct. Because of this minor fluency issue, FS = 0.5."
"This bot is seriously driving us crazy This image exists, I must kill it!","This bot is seriously driving us crazy This image exists, I must kill it!",0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The supposedly neutral sentence is identical to the toxic one; violent language (“I must kill it!”) is still present, so no toxic content was removed → 0.
CS: Because the sentences are identical, the original meaning is fully preserved → 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but contains punctuation/segmentation problems (two clauses run together without proper punctuation), making it slightly awkward → 0.5."
Have you been fucking living under a rock?,Have you been living under a rock?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy: The only toxic element is the expletive “fucking,” which has been completely removed. The resulting sentence is entirely neutral, so STA = 1.
Content Similarity: Aside from deleting the expletive, every other word and the rhetorical meaning of the original sentence are preserved. No core information is lost, so CS = 1.
Fluency: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, idiomatic, and fully understandable, yielding FS = 1.
Joint score: The average of the three 1-scores is (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1.0."
"I will do Whatever i want and it is my right, what is both of yous Problem Asshole.","I will do whatever i want and it is my right, what is both of you",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicit insult “Asshole” has been removed and no other toxic terms are present, so the text is fully neutral (score 1).
CS: The central assertion “I will do whatever I want and it is my right” is preserved, but the follow-up question loses the key word “problem” and stops at “what is both of you,” which no longer conveys the original query. Thus only part of the original meaning remains (score 0.5).
FS: The sentence is mostly readable, but there are noticeable issues: lack of capitalisation on ‘I’, missing punctuation, and the fragment “what is both of you” is grammatically incorrect. These errors hinder, but do not completely block, comprehension (score 0.5)."
How the hell are you going to block me from editting?,How are you going to block me from editting?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the toxic phrase ""the hell,"" leaving a completely non-profane question, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the profanity, all information (the question about being blocked from editing) is retained, so CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable and grammatically fine, but the misspelling ""editting"" harms fluency; therefore FS = 0.5.
Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
WTF How The Fuck Does This Person Merit A Page On Wikipedia.,How does this person Merit A Page On Wikipedia.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: All profanities ('WTF', 'the fuck') have been removed, and the rewritten sentence is fully neutral, so STA = 1.
CS: The neutral sentence still expresses the same core idea—questioning why the person deserves a Wikipedia page—so the meaning is fully preserved, CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but there are minor fluency issues: unnecessary capitalization of 'Merit', 'A', and 'Page'. These cosmetic errors hinder perfect grammaticality, therefore FS = 0.5.
Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
"I'm retired, fuckers, leave me alone.","I'm retired, leave me alone.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit insult ""fuckers"" has been completely removed, resulting in a fully neutral sentence, so STA = 1. CS: The core message—that the speaker is retired and wants to be left alone—remains intact; no essential information is lost, so CS = 1. FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatically correct, and fully fluent, so FS = 1."
This profile has protected Bermender since day fukkin ONE.,This profile has protected Bermender since day ONE.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the profanity 'fukkin'. The neutral sentence removes this word entirely, leaving no toxic or offensive content, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the profanity, every other word and the original structure are preserved. The meaning— that the profile has protected Bermender from the very first day—remains intact. Therefore CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is fully grammatical, clear, and natural-sounding. No spelling or syntactic issues are present, so FS = 1."
"Please carry on, so everyone can see what an ignorant arse you are.","Please carry on, so everyone can see what an ignorant person you are.",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The explicit profanity ""arse"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""person"", reducing the toxicity. However, the sentence still directly insults the addressee as ""ignorant person"", which keeps a personal attack in place, so toxicity is only partially removed. CS: Aside from the single-word substitution, the message (urging someone to continue so others can witness their ignorance) is fully preserved; no core information is lost. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, natural, and easy to read with no errors. Hence scores are STA 0.5, CS 1, FS 1; the joint score is the average 0.83."
I drive a Subaru Legacy and I'm a conservative But I still think you're an idiot.,I drive a Subaru Legacy and I'm a conservative But I still think you're wrong,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive term ""idiot"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""wrong,"" eliminating the direct insult, so toxicity is fully removed ⇒ 1.
CS: All factual information is kept (drives a Subaru Legacy, is conservative, still holds a negative opinion). The shift from ""idiot"" to ""wrong"" softens tone but does not drop core content (continued disagreement/negative judgment) ⇒ 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but has punctuation/capitalization issues (missing comma before ""but,"" capital ‘B’ mid-sentence). These minor errors reduce smoothness ⇒ 0.5."
"Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be an arse hole","Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be a bad person.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity ""arse hole"" has been replaced with the neutral phrase ""bad person,"" removing toxic or vulgar language completely.
CS: Both sentences convey the same core message: the writer tells Greenman that he habitually proves himself to be an unpleasant individual. No key information is lost or added.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, coherent, and easy to read.
Overall, all three dimensions meet the highest criteria, so the joint score is 1.0."
"You're not an admin, so shut the fuck up faggot.","You're not an admin, so keep quiet.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy: All toxic slurs and profanity (“shut the fuck up faggot”) were entirely removed and replaced with the neutral phrase “keep quiet,” so the output is fully detoxified (score 1). Content Similarity: The core message—‘You’re not an admin, therefore you should be quiet’—is fully retained, with no significant information lost (score 1). Fluency: The resulting sentence is short, grammatically correct, and natural-sounding, with no errors (score 1). Therefore, the average joint score is 1.0."
"Yes, the wikipedia page, like I just mentioned, dumbass.","Yes, the wikipedia page, like I just mentioned.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""dumbass"" is completely removed, leaving no offensive language, so the style transfer accuracy is perfect.
CS: The informational content (affirming the Wikipedia page was mentioned) is fully preserved; only the insult was deleted, which does not change the meaning.
FS: The rewritten sentence is clear and grammatically acceptable. While the commas create a slightly informal pause, it is fully fluent and easily understandable, thus scoring full marks."
"oh shit, nooooo, is someone going to spank me now?","Oh no, is someone going to  me now?",1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA): The profanity ""shit"" has been completely removed and no other toxic or profane words remain, so the resulting sentence is fully neutral. Hence, STA = 1.

Content Similarity (CS): The original sentence’s core idea is worry about being ""spanked."" The detoxified version deletes the verb entirely (""is someone going to  me now?"") so the key action is missing, creating an unclear or different meaning. Therefore the fundamental information is not preserved. CS = 0.

Fluency (FS): The sentence is mostly readable, but the missing verb after ""to"" makes it ungrammatical and awkward. Because it is still partly comprehensible but clearly flawed, FS = 0.5.

Thank you.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The profane phrase ""fucking up"" is replaced by the non-profane verb ""destroying,"" removing explicit toxicity. No other insulting or vulgar language remains, so toxic style is fully neutralised → 1.
CS: Apart from the profanity replacement, every piece of information (topic: Steak Diane, request to stop altering edits, expression of thanks) is preserved. Meaning and intent are unchanged → 1.
FS: The text is understandable but not perfectly grammatical: it begins with the fragment ""Steak Diane"" without punctuation (should be followed by a colon or comma), and ""diane"" is not capitalised consistently. These minor issues reduce smoothness, but the sentence is still readable → 0.5."
You amins are such bastards.,You are such unpleasant people.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic term ""bastards"" is replaced by the neutral phrase ""unpleasant people,"" and no other offensive language remains, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1).
CS: The sentence still expresses a negative judgment toward the same addressees, preserving the main intent (insult). However, the word ""amins"" (likely referring to a specific subgroup such as ""admins"" or another identifier) has been dropped, so part of the original information is lost. Hence only partial meaning preservation (score 0.5).
FS: ""You are such unpleasant people."" is grammatically correct, natural sounding, and easy to understand; no fluency issues are present (score 1)."
"Quit Defacing my user page, you ugly cunt.-",Quit Defacing my user page.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive phrase ""you ugly cunt"" has been entirely removed, leaving no toxic language, so style transfer accuracy is perfect (1).
CS: The essential message—requesting the addressee to stop defacing the user page—remains intact. The removed segment was purely abusive and not part of the core meaning, so content is fully preserved (1).
FS: ""Quit Defacing my user page."" is grammatically correct, clear, and easily readable. Although capitalizing ""Defacing"" mid-sentence is slightly unconventional, it does not impede fluency; thus fluency is considered perfect (1)."
I forgot to mention the even sadder cunt that is,I forgot to mention the even sadder person that is,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic slur ""cunt"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""person."" No other offensive language remains, so toxic content has been completely removed. 

CS: The substitution of “cunt” with “person” keeps the propositional content the same: the speaker still says they forgot to mention someone who is ""even sadder."" No core information is lost, so full meaning preservation is achieved. 

FS: While the sentence is understandable, it is grammatically incomplete (""...that is"" lacks a complement) and sounds awkward. This lowers fluency but does not render the sentence unintelligible. Hence, a partial score of 0.5 is appropriate.
"
Randi was born a DICK.,Randi was born a bad person.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive slur ""DICK"" has been removed and replaced with a neutral phrase ""bad person."" No profanity or hate‐related language remains, so the text is fully detoxified (score 1).
CS: ""A dick"" in the original sentence is an insult meaning someone is an unpleasant or bad person. The neutral sentence keeps the same negative assessment of Randi, so the core meaning is fully preserved (score 1).
FS: ""Randi was born a bad person"" is grammatically correct and easy to read, albeit slightly colloquial. There are no errors that impede comprehension, so it is considered fully fluent (score 1)."

CS: Aside from the single word replacement, the sentence keeps the same structure and intent (issuing a final warning and asking the addressee to change behavior), thus meaning is fully preserved, so CS = 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical and fluent; punctuation and wording are correct and natural, so FS = 1."
"MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize, so fuck you.",My USER PAGE I will say what I want I do not vandalize.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The explicitly toxic phrase “fuck you” has been fully removed, and no new toxic language appears, so the detoxification is complete.
CS: The main propositions — it is the speaker’s user page, they will say what they want, and they do not vandalize — are all retained. Removing the abusive phrase does not alter these factual claims, so the core meaning is preserved.
FS: The sentence remains understandable but is not fully fluent: there is no punctuation separating clauses, inconsistent capitalization persists (""USER PAGE""), and the sentence feels run-on. Hence, it is only partially fluent."
I am Nancy and I like to fuck up people's fun.,I am Nancy and I like to spoil people's fun.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive phrase 'fuck up' has been fully replaced with the neutral verb 'spoil', removing all toxic language, so the style transfer accuracy is 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps every piece of original information (speaker is Nancy, enjoys ruining others’ fun) with no semantic loss, so content similarity is 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and fully fluent, so fluency is 1."
"Heh, look, not EVERYTHING is on google. you are a dumbass.","Heh, look, not EVERYTHING is on google. You are not smart.",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The offensive slur ""dumbass"" was replaced with the milder phrase ""not smart,"" which removes the vulgarity but still delivers a negative personal judgement. Because a direct personal insult remains, toxic content is only partially removed, so STA = 0.5.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps every piece of factual information (the remark about Google and the speaker’s opinion of the addressee’s intelligence). No core meaning is lost, hence CS = 1.
FS: The rewritten text is grammatically correct, well-punctuated, and fully comprehensible. No fluency issues were detected, so FS = 1."
Thanks for being an ass when I tried to help.,Thanks for being mean when I tried to help.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic term ""ass"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""mean,"" eliminating any profanity; no other toxic language remains, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from substituting a single adjective, the sentence keeps the same structure and conveys the identical idea (expressing sarcasm/thanks and noting unhelpful behavior while trying to help), so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and easy to understand with no errors, so FS = 1."
"You're a fucking moron, go read the notability guidelines.",Go read the notability guidelines.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All toxic elements (""fucking moron"") are completely removed, leaving a fully neutral sentence, so the score is 1.
CS: The essential informational content—an instruction to read the notability guidelines—is fully preserved. The removed portion is purely the toxic insult, which is considered stylistic rather than core informational content, so CS = 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is short, grammatical, and perfectly fluent. No errors or awkward phrasing are present, so FS = 1."
Some bubble tea for you! thanks ass hole,Some bubble tea for you! Thanks,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic phrase ""ass hole"" has been completely removed and no other offensive words remain, so style transfer accuracy is perfect.

CS: The neutral sentence still conveys the act of offering bubble tea and saying thanks, but it loses the negative/insulting attitude that was present in the original. Because part of the original meaning (the speaker’s hostility) is omitted, only partial semantic preservation is achieved. Hence 0.5.

FS: ""Some bubble tea for you! Thanks"" is grammatically correct, clear, and fully readable; therefore fluency is rated 1."
And your dumb people fell for his shenanigans.,And your people fell for his shenanigans.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element is the insult ""dumb"". It has been entirely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so the style transfer is fully successful (1).
CS: Apart from deleting the insult, every other piece of semantic information (""your people fell for his shenanigans"") is kept. The core meaning—someone's people were deceived—remains intact, so content similarity is complete (1).
FS: The neutral output is short, grammatically correct, and fully understandable. There are no awkward constructions or errors, yielding perfect fluency (1)."
These people are INSANE.,These people are not good.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic slur ""INSANE"" has been replaced with the mild phrase ""not good,"" which is a neutral, non-toxic evaluation. No insulting or hateful language remains, so STA = 1.
CS: Both sentences convey a negative judgement toward the same group of people, but the specific idea that they are mentally unstable (""insane"") is lost and replaced by a vague moral assessment (""not good""). Core negativity is preserved, yet some semantic detail is missing, so CS = 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatically correct, and fully understandable with no awkwardness, so FS = 1."
Did you know that you are an ugly piece of shit?,Did you know that you are not good?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The original toxic phrase ""ugly piece of shit"" is fully removed; the replacement ""not good"" is non-toxic and merely a mild criticism, so toxicity is eliminated (score 1).
CS: The source sentence expresses a strong negative judgment about the addressee. The neutral sentence still conveys a negative judgment (""you are not good""), but it drops the specific insults of ugliness and vulgar language, so some semantic content is lost (score 0.5).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding English with no errors (score 1)."
Be careful who you call a moron.,Be careful who you call.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic term “moron” has been completely removed and no other offensive wording appears, so style transfer is fully successful (1).
CS: The source warns people about using the word “moron.” The neutral version only says “Be careful who you call,” omitting what is being called. The general idea of caution remains, but the specific target word is lost, representing partial meaning preservation (0.5).
FS: The rewritten sentence is short, grammatical, and easily understandable, with no fluency problems (1)."
"Yeah, you can fuck off incel.","Yeah, you can leave incel.",0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicit profanity 'fuck off' was softened to 'leave', but the derogatory term 'incel' is still present, so toxic content is only partially removed. CS: The core intent—telling the addressee to go away—remains intact; no substantive information is lost. FS: The sentence is understandable, but the lack of a comma before the vocative 'incel' (""Yeah, you can leave, incel."") makes it slightly awkward and potentially ambiguous, so fluency is acceptable but not perfect."
"Stop defending pedophiles, faggot.",Stop defending .,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"STA: All toxic elements (the slur ""faggot"" and the aggressive tone toward the addressee) have been fully removed, producing a neutral text. Therefore, Style Transfer Accuracy = 1.

CS: The original sentence tells someone to ""Stop defending pedophiles."" In the neutral version the object has been deleted, leaving only ""Stop defending ."" Thus the core meaning—specifically whom the addressee is being told not to defend—is lost. Content preservation is essentially absent, so CS = 0.

FS: The resulting sentence is ungrammatical and awkward: ""Stop defending ."" is incomplete and contains a stray space before the period. It reads as an unfinished fragment and hinders comprehension. Hence Fluency = 0.

Joint score is the arithmetic mean of the three sub-scores: (1 + 0 + 0) / 3 ≈ 0.33."
"No one is vandalizing assholes, so get it straight!!!","No one is vandalizing, so get it straight",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""assholes"" has been completely removed and the remaining sentence contains no overtly insulting or hateful language, so toxicity is fully neutralized.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps all the informational content: it still states that no one is vandalizing and urges the listener to understand that. Only the insult term was dropped, so the core meaning is intact.
FS: The resulting sentence is grammatical and easy to read. The comma before ""so"" is acceptable in informal prose, and there are no other errors. Hence it is fully fluent."
"DUDE CALM THE FUCK DOWN!!!
",DUDE CALM DOWN!,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive phrase ""THE FUCK"" has been entirely removed, leaving a fully neutral sentence, so the detoxification is complete. CS: The imperative message—asking the person to calm down—remains fully intact; only the profane intensifier was omitted, so the core meaning is preserved. FS: ""DUDE CALM DOWN!"" is short, grammatical, and easily understandable; while it is written in all-caps, this doesn’t impair readability or grammar, hence fluent."
"Some jackass vandalized the article again, can someone fix it?","Someone vandalized the article again, can someone fix it?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The insulting term ""jackass"" is removed, and no other toxic language remains, so toxic style has been fully neutralized.
CS: Replacing ""Some jackass"" with ""Someone"" keeps the meaning that an unspecified person vandalized the article; no core information is lost.
FS: The sentence is grammatical and easy to read. Although the word ""someone"" appears twice, this repetition does not impede readability, so fluency is high."
I'm afraid I can't verify it as his myspace account has been deleted I fucking hate you.,I'm afraid I can't verify it as his myspace account has been deleted.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic phrase ""I fucking hate you"" has been completely removed, and the remaining sentence is neutral, so the style transfer accuracy is 1. 
CS: The factual part about being unable to verify because the MySpace account was deleted is preserved, but the speaker's expression of personal hatred is omitted. This information is part of the original meaning even though it is toxic, so some semantic content is lost. Hence CS is 0.5. 
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, coherent, and fully fluent, therefore FS is 1."
He deserves every beating and rape he will be subjected to.,He deserves every beating and  he will be subjected to.,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"STA: The word ""rape""—one of the most explicitly toxic elements—has been removed, but the sentence still contains the violent wish ""He deserves every beating,"" which is clearly toxic. Hence, toxic content is only partially removed → 0.5. CS: By deleting the word ""rape,"" part of the original meaning (that he also deserves rape) is lost, yet the rest of the meaning (that he deserves severe violence) is preserved → partial preservation → 0.5. FS: The resulting sentence is grammatical-ly flawed: ""every beating and  he will be subjected to"" lacks an object after ""and,"" leaving an unfinished coordination. It is still understandable but not fully fluent → 0.5."
