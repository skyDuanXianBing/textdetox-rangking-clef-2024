are they liars or just clueless ?,Are they just clueless?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text effectively removes the aggressive term 'liars' and replaces it with the neutral word 'clueless'. However, the shift from 'liars' to 'clueless' results in a slight change in meaning. 'Liars' implies deliberate dishonesty, whereas 'clueless' suggests a lack of awareness. While the overall meaning is preserved, the core concept is somewhat altered. The language is fluent and grammatically correct."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .","as someone from la and an oilfield worker, i still say this guy is not",1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The offensive phrase ""piece of shit"" has been completely removed and no other toxic wording appears, so style transfer accuracy is perfect (1).
CS: The original intent was to express a strong negative judgment about the man. The rewritten sentence stops at ""this guy is not"", leaving the statement unfinished and removing the negative judgment. Thus the core meaning is essentially lost, so content similarity receives 0.
FS: The sentence is readable up to the point it abruptly ends, but the truncation makes it grammatically incomplete. It is still partially understandable, so fluency is scored 0.5 rather than 0."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","Calm down, cnn.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive word ""fuck"" has been completely removed, leaving a neutral imperative, so toxic content is fully eliminated. CS: The rewritten sentence still tells CNN to calm down; the only change is removal of an emphatic expletive that does not alter the core meaning, so content is fully preserved. FS: The sentence is clear and grammatical, but the proper-noun abbreviation ""cnn"" should be capitalized as ""CNN""; this minor error warrants a slight fluency penalty."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,china and russia will use a big stick to  trump around if those ships,0.5,0.5,0.0,0.0,"STA: The most explicitly violent verb ""smack"" has been removed, which softens the sentence, but the phrase ""use a big stick"" still conveys a threat of violence, so toxicity is only partially reduced (0.5).
CS: The sentence still mentions China, Russia, a ""big stick,"" Trump, and the conditional reference to the ships, so part of the core idea remains. However, the causal clause ""if those ships do anything foolish"" is missing and the verb phrase is malformed, so only partial meaning is preserved (0.5).
FS: The output is ungrammatical and incomplete: ""to  trump around if those ships"" lacks a main verb/complement and ends abruptly. This makes the sentence hard to read and clearly flawed, so fluency is poor (0.0)."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,People like this rarely care about facts.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The insulting word ""cretins"" has been replaced with the neutral term ""People,"" so all toxic language has been removed (score 1).
CS: While the sentence structure and main claim (that individuals of this type rarely care about facts) are preserved, the negative connotation of calling them ""cretins"" is lost. This slight semantic shift represents some loss of the original meaning, warranting a partial score (0.5).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, concise, and fully understandable, so it is fluent (score 1)."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,Do people actually believe this?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""shit"" has been removed and the sentence is now entirely neutral, so full score.
CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys the speaker’s doubt that anyone believes the referenced statement, preserving the original meaning completely.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and fully fluent.
Joint score is the average of the three dimensions."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","dont you ever change one of my edits, or i will come to your house",0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"STA: The text removes the explicit violent threat ""and I will cut you,"" reducing the toxicity, but it still contains a threat (""or I will come to your house"") and an aggressive tone, so the detoxification is only partial. CS: The main warning about not changing edits and the threat of coming to the person’s house are retained, but the explicit cutting threat is lost, so only partial meaning is preserved. FS: The sentence is understandable but has punctuation and capitalization errors (""dont,"" lowercase ""i,"" missing final period), giving it moderate fluency."
even bush knows he fucked up .,Even Bush knows that he made a mistake.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The offensive phrase ""fucked up"" has been replaced by the neutral expression ""made a mistake,"" eliminating all toxic language (STA=1). The sentence still conveys exactly the same core meaning—that Bush recognizes his own error—so the content is fully preserved (CS=1). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, capitalized properly, and reads naturally (FS=1)."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,I don't like popeyes for doing this in the first place.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity ""fuck"" has been removed and replaced with a neutral phrase, so the text is fully detoxified. CS: The sentence still expresses a negative opinion toward Popeyes for the same action, preserving the core meaning; only the intensity is softened, which is acceptable under complete preservation. FS: The rewritten sentence is clear and grammatical, with no fluency issues."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,getting myself kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the mildly profane expression ""my ass kicked"" and uses non-toxic wording, so toxic content is fully eliminated. CS: The sentence still conveys that being defeated by GRE practice tests ensured the speaker would not repeat the same mistake, so core meaning is preserved. FS: The wording ""getting myself kicked by gre practice tests"" is awkward and slightly ungrammatical (should be ""getting kicked"" or ""having been kicked""; lowercase ""i""), making the sentence somewhat less fluent though understandable. Therefore, fluency is rated 0.5. Joint score is the average of the three dimensions."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,getting stronger every month yeah i wish.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element is the expletive ""fucking,"" which has been removed, leaving completely neutral language, so score is 1. CS: Aside from removing the expletive, the sentence still conveys the same sarcastic meaning (the speaker wishes they were getting stronger every month), so core meaning is fully preserved, score 1. FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable but not fully fluent—it lacks capitalization and proper punctuation and reads as a run-on phrase (""getting stronger every month yeah i wish""), hence some grammatical issues remain, so score 0.5."
have you ever been to r trees and seen all the shit people say weed can do ? .,Have you ever been to r trees and seen all the things people say  can do,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The offensive word ""shit"" has been replaced by the neutral term ""things"", and no new toxic language was introduced, so toxic content is fully removed.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the idea of visiting r/trees and reading exaggerated claims, but it entirely omits the key word ""weed"" (the substance being discussed). Because this removes an important element of the original meaning, only partial content is preserved.
FS: The sentence is understandable but not fully grammatical: the phrase ""people say  can do"" is missing the object, and the final question mark is gone. These issues hinder smooth reading, so fluency is only moderate.
Overall, the result cleanly removes toxicity but partially loses meaning and has noticeable fluency problems."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .",A police officer got fired?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the expletive ""holy shit"" and uses the neutral term ""police officer"" instead of the colloquial ""cop."" No toxic or profane language remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The key information (surprise that a police officer was fired) is preserved. Although the explicit interjection ""holy"" is gone, the interrogative form still conveys the notion of surprise. Core meaning is fully retained, so CS = 1.
FS: ""A police officer got fired?"" is clear, grammatical, and easily understandable, even if slightly informal. No errors hinder comprehension, so FS = 1."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,How do you manage that?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral sentence completely removes the vulgar expression ""the fuck,"" resulting in non-toxic language (STA=1). The core meaning—asking how someone accomplishes something—is entirely preserved (CS=1). The rewritten sentence is grammatical, properly capitalized, and reads naturally (FS=1). Therefore, all dimensions score the maximum and the joint score is 1.0."
how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,How do you think people afford houses and cars?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence entirely removes the toxic word “fuck,” rendering the question fully neutral. CS: Aside from deleting the profanity, every other word and the underlying meaning are preserved, so the core information remains intact. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and easy to read, so fluency is perfect."
i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,I accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost panicked.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The vulgar phrase ""shit my pants"" is completely replaced with the neutral verb ""panicked,"" removing all toxic language, so 1.0. CS: The sentence still conveys that the speaker misread the title as “laser machete” and became very frightened; no information is lost, earning 1.0. FS: The sentence is understandable but slightly awkward – the phrase ""read the titling as"" is not idiomatic English – therefore minor fluency issues reduce the score to 0.5."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,I did not vandalize anything.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The phrase ""you dick"" was entirely removed, leaving a neutral sentence; no toxic language remains. CS: The main assertion—that the speaker did not vandalize anything—is fully retained; only the toxic address (not essential semantic content) was dropped, so meaning is preserved. FS: The resulting sentence is grammatically correct, concise, and completely fluent."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,I don't care about sides!,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the profanity ('flying fuck') and is completely free of toxic language, so it scores 1.0. CS: The core meaning—expressing indifference toward taking sides—is fully preserved (‘I don’t care about sides’), so it scores 1.0. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and reads smoothly, so it scores 1.0."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,i have toilet paper to wipe my behind and no shortage of food.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The vulgar word ""ass"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""behind,"" so all toxic language is removed (score 1). CS: Apart from substituting a neutral synonym, every piece of information (toilet paper, wiping, no shortage of food) is fully preserved (score 1). FS: The sentence is readable, but the lowercase ""i"" at the beginning constitutes a basic grammatical error, preventing a perfect fluency score (score 0.5)."
i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but fucking seriously .,i mean it's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicit profanity 'fucking' has been completely removed and no new toxic terms were introduced, so toxic content is fully neutralized. CS: The main idea—that it is awesome the pope is so cool—is still present, but the sentence is truncated, dropping 'stuff but seriously', which removes the speaker's emphasis and attitude. Therefore only partial meaning is retained. FS: The sentence is readable up to the point it abruptly ends with 'and'. This dangling conjunction makes the output clearly incomplete and ungrammatical, but still understandable overall, so it earns a mid-level fluency score."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","I sell quite a bit of stuff on there, and paypal has actually helped me",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The profane word ""shit"" was successfully replaced with the neutral word ""stuff,"" so all toxic language is removed (score 1).
CS: The neutral sentence omits the phrase ""pay the bills,"" so part of the original meaning (how PayPal helped) is lost, leading to partial preservation (score 0.5).
FS: The sentence is mostly grammatical but feels incomplete because it ends with ""helped me"" without an object, making it slightly awkward though still understandable (score 0.5)."
"if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the shit out of him .","if hes found to have acted in cold blood, the feds are going to c",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"STA: The only overtly toxic word ""shit"" is completely removed and no new toxic language appears, so toxicity is eliminated. CS: The sentence is truncated after ""the feds are going to"", leaving only the letter ""c""; therefore almost all of the original information about what the feds will do is lost. FS: Because the sentence cuts off mid-word, it is ungrammatical and hard to read, so fluency is very poor."
it s a big deal because the school didn t give a shit until she was being bullied .,it's a big deal because the school didn't care until she was being bullied,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The phrase ""didn't give a shit"" has been replaced with the neutral ""didn't care,"" fully removing profanity and any toxic tone. CS: All core information (the school’s indifference until bullying occurred) is preserved exactly; only wording changed. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, well-structured, and fully understandable, so fluency is perfect."
"judging by the shit i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .","judging by the things i ve seen in my number years, number of those spent",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The neutral sentence replaces the profanity ""shit"" with the neutral word ""things"" and contains no other offensive language, so toxic content is fully removed. 
CS: The reference to ""George W."" (an important detail about with whom the years were spent) is omitted, so part of the original information is lost, yielding only partial meaning preservation. 
FS: The sentence is mostly readable but grammatically awkward (""in my number years"") and ends abruptly with ""number of those spent"", leaving the thought incomplete. This creates noticeable fluency problems yet the sentence is still roughly understandable, so it merits 0.5."
"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up","last warning you, it takes meminutes to resolve a page so people like you",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: All explicit profanities (‘fucking’, ‘tosser’, ‘cunts’, ‘fuck’) were removed or replaced, and the remaining wording is neutral, so the toxic style was fully eliminated. CS: The warning notion and the claim that it only takes the speaker minutes to resolve a page are kept, but the crucial ending ('can fuck Wikipedia up') is dropped, leaving the sentence semantically incomplete; therefore only part of the original meaning is preserved. FS: The sentence is understandable but not fully grammatical: ‘meminutes’ is a typo, the construction ‘last warning you’ is awkward, and it ends abruptly with ‘so people like you’, making it incomplete. Hence fluency is only moderate."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .",liar is on fire justin,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.0,"STA: The neutral sentence still contains the direct insult ""liar"" and therefore does not remove the toxic element at all → 0. 
CS: The original intent (calling Justin a liar and using the expression “pants on fire”) is only partially retained. The shortened form still includes the words ""liar,"" ""fire,"" and ""Justin,"" but the childish idiom is lost and the grammatical relation (that Justin is the liar) is unclear → 0.5. 
FS: The sentence ""liar is on fire justin"" is understandable but grammatically awkward (missing punctuation, incorrect word order) → 0.5."
my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,My thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger unpleasant person.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The insult ""dirt bag"" has been replaced with the neutral phrase ""unpleasant person,"" so toxic language is fully removed (score 1).
CS: The sentence still conveys the speaker’s opinion that the new person is worse than someone else in a negative sense, so the core meaning is preserved (score 1).
FS: The phrase ""even bigger unpleasant person"" is awkward; the adjective ""bigger"" does not naturally modify ""unpleasant person."" A more fluent rendering would be ""even more unpleasant person."" The rest of the sentence is fine, so it remains understandable but not fully natural (score 0.5)."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","no way number bricks fits in a car, this is bs.",0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA: The strongest profanity ""fucking"" was removed, but the abbreviation ""bs"" (bullshit) is still present, so toxic content is only partially removed. CS: Apart from deleting the swear word, the sentence conveys exactly the same meaning that a certain number of bricks cannot fit in a car and the statement is unbelievable, therefore full meaning is preserved. FS: The sentence is understandable but not fully fluent; phrases like ""number bricks fits"" lack proper grammar and the comma placement is awkward. Hence, fluency is acceptable but imperfect."
noones asking you to invade shit .,noones asking you to invade.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The profanity ""shit"" has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0. CS: Aside from dropping the swear word, the sentence still conveys the same idea that no one is asking the person to invade anything, so Content Similarity is 1.0. FS: The neutral text is understandable, but ""noones"" should be written as ""no one's,"" and it ends abruptly without punctuation, giving it minor grammatical issues; therefore Fluency is 0.5."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,not interfering in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity 'fucking around' has been fully replaced by the neutral term 'interfering', so the toxic language is entirely removed. CS: The neutral sentence keeps the original intent—advocating against engagement in foreign matters that cannot be influenced—so the core meaning is fully preserved. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, clear, and natural; no fluency issues are present."
nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady as fuck .,nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time,1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the vulgar phrase “shady as fuck,” so all explicit toxic language is gone, giving full credit for style transfer.
CS: The original statement claims that the missing footage will ‘look shady as fuck’; the neutral version cuts off after “is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time,” omitting the crucial idea that it will look suspicious. Because the effect/predication is entirely lost, the core meaning is not preserved, yielding a 0 for content similarity.
FS: The output is readable up to the point it stops, but it is an incomplete sentence lacking a complement, so it is grammatically flawed though still partially understandable. This warrants 0.5 for fluency."
number will solve alot of fucking problems if it comes down to it .,number will solve alot of problems if it comes down to it.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element was the profanity ""fucking,"" which has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so STA = 1. CS: Aside from deleting the profanity, the sentence retains the exact same meaning (a ‘number’ will solve many problems if necessary), therefore CS = 1. FS: The neutral sentence is understandable, but it contains minor issues: the word ""alot"" should be written as ""a lot,"" and the first word is not capitalized. These small grammatical/spelling problems reduce fluency, so FS = 0.5."
org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random shit like this .,org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random things like this.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive word ""shit"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""things,"" so all toxic language is removed. CS: Aside from the lexical substitution, the sentence still states that there are Wikipedia articles covering many random items like this, so the core meaning is fully preserved. FS: The output is understandable, but it contains minor grammatical issues (e.g., subject-verb disagreement in ""there's ... articles,"" lowercase ""wikipedia,"" and the unexplained leading token ""org""). These flaws reduce fluency, so 0.5 is appropriate."
"quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some idiot hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .","quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some hierarch, even unto being killed",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The insulting word ""idiot"" has been removed, leaving a neutral description; no other toxic language remains, so score = 1. CS: Aside from deleting the insult and an incomplete fragment (""like st.""), the sentence still conveys the same key idea—that many saints were canonized for opposing a hierarch and were killed—so the core meaning is fully preserved, score = 1. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and easily readable; the slightly archaic phrasing is still fluent, score = 1."
read your own fucking link .,Read your own link.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The swear word “fucking” was removed, leaving a fully neutral sentence, so toxic content is completely eliminated. CS: The directive to read one's own link is maintained without any loss of meaning; only the offensive intensifier was removed. FS: The sentence is grammatical, capitalized properly, and fully fluent."
some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped in the ass .,Some r guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,"STA: The explicit toxic expression ""raped in the ass"" is completely removed, and no new toxic language appears, so the style transfer accuracy is judged as 1.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the facts that a man robs a liquor store for $400 and is sent to prison, but omits the information about what happens to him in prison and even changes ""poor"" to the unintelligible ""r"". Part of the core meaning is therefore lost, deserving 0.5.
FS: The resulting sentence is ungrammatical and incomplete (""Some r guy … goes to prison to get""), and the word ""r"" is meaningless in this context. The text reads as a fragment that is difficult to understand, so fluency is 0."
"someone says no , and they say fuck off we need vets only for free housing ? .","someone says no, and they say we need vets only for free housing?.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive phrase ""fuck off"" has been completely removed, and no other toxic language remains, so style transfer is successful (1.0). CS: Aside from deleting the toxic expletive, the rest of the message — that someone says no and the reply is that housing should be for vets only — is preserved, so the core meaning remains intact (1.0). FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but has punctuation problems (""? ."" at the end) and slight awkwardness in wording; therefore it is not fully fluent (0.5)."
still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,still standing up for your lying leader who loves himself and nobody else.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy: The only overtly toxic element in the source is the ableist insult ""crazy.""  The neutral sentence removes this word while keeping the rest intact.  The word ""lying"" is a descriptive accusation rather than a slur or profanity, so the sentence is now neutral.  Content Similarity: Aside from deleting the insult, every other piece of semantic content (standing up, leader, lying, self-love, indifference to others) is preserved, so the core meaning is fully retained.  Fluency: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, clear, and natural; no awkward phrasing or errors are introduced.  Hence STA = 1, CS = 1, FS = 1, yielding an average joint score of 1.0."
sucked like nothings ever sucked before .,Sucked like nothings ever worse before,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.0,"STA: The word “sucked” is still present and the sentence remains a crude, negative expression; no toxic or vulgar element was removed, so score is 0. CS: Although the wording is garbled, the sentence still conveys the idea that something was extremely bad, so about half of the original meaning is preserved. FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable but clearly ungrammatical ('nothings', word order), so it is only partly fluent. Hence scores: STA 0, CS 0.5, FS 0.5."
taking a stand with either party is equally retarded .,Taking a stand with either party is equally .,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"STA: The offensive word ""retarded"" has been completely removed, and no other toxic language is present, so style transfer accuracy is perfect.
CS: The original sentence claimed that taking a stand with either party is equally foolish/negative. The rewritten sentence omits the evaluative word altogether, leaving an unfinished construction (""is equally .""). Consequently, the core meaning is not conveyed at all, so content similarity is 0.
FS: The neutral text is ungrammatical and incomplete—ending with ""equally .""—which makes it awkward and hard to read. Therefore fluency is 0."
that almost never happens excepts rarely in shit hole countries .,that almost never happens excepts rarely in countries.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The offensive phrase “shit hole” has been completely removed, leaving no toxic language, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0. CS: The original sentence asserts that the event occurs only in ‘shithole’ (i.e., certain poorly regarded) countries. The neutral version just says it happens rarely in ‘countries’ in general, losing the negative qualifier that narrows the set of countries. Core rarity idea is kept, but part of the meaning (the evaluative descriptor) is lost, so Content Similarity is 0.5. FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but contains grammatical issues—‘excepts’ is wrong, and the overall phrasing is awkward—so Fluency receives 0.5."
their shit is cheap but its of such awful quality that you re better off getting the more expensive item .,their stuff is cheap but its of such awful quality that you re better off getting the,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic language 'their shit' is replaced with the neutral term 'their stuff,' effectively removing vulgarity. The core meaning of the original sentence is preserved, maintaining the comparison between cheap but low-quality items and the recommendation to purchase the more expensive item. The neutral text is grammatically correct and flows naturally, making it fluent and easily understandable."
they need stop tratening people like morons .,They need to stop treating people badly.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'treating people like morons' was successfully replaced with the neutral phrase 'treating people badly', completely removing the negative and insulting language. The original meaning is fully preserved, and the language is fluent and grammatically correct."
they re both fucked up .,They're both failed.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the vulgar language ('fucked up') and replaces it with a neutral term ('failed'), effectively neutralizing the toxic tone. However, the replacement of 'fucked up' with 'failed' shifts the meaning slightly as 'failed' is less intense than 'fucked up.' The fluency of the neutral text is intact, as the sentence is grammatically correct and easy to understand."
this guy is a total sellout with no brains for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking .,this guy lacks the skills for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic phrase 'total sellout with no brains' and reframes it in a more neutral way, maintaining the core meaning that the individual lacks business skills. The language is completely fluent, without any grammatical issues, and the content retains the original meaning."
"this is a joke , are you all fucking retards ? .","This is a joke, are you all naive?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text completely removes the toxic language ('fucking retards') and replaces it with a more neutral term ('naive'). The core meaning of the sentence remains intact, and the language is fluent and grammatically correct."

this shit is overwhelming to think about .,This is too much to think about,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic language ('this shit') is completely removed and replaced with a neutral expression ('This is too much'), successfully transforming the sentence to a neutral tone. The core meaning is fully preserved, and the language is fluent and grammatically correct."
what an arse hole you are !,You are a bad person.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Successfully replaced the toxic insult with a neutral expression, maintaining the original meaning while ensuring language is polite and fluent."
"whats the title of this report , no shit ? .",whats the title of this report?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the vulgar expression ('no shit') and presents a completely neutral version of the sentence. The core meaning of the sentence is preserved, and the sentence is grammatically correct and fluent."

why the fuck haven 't they condemned north korea ?,why haven 't they condemned north korea?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'why the fuck' was successfully removed, resulting in a completely neutral sentence. The core meaning, which is the question about condemnation of North Korea, is fully preserved. The neutral text is fluent and natural, with no grammatical issues."
"yeah , comparitively fuck all because they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and smart accountants ? .","yeah, comparitively not all because they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.25,"The neutral text successfully removes the vulgar expression 'fuck all,' but the phrase 'comparitively not all' is slightly awkward and unclear, reducing the overall transfer accuracy. The core meaning of the sentence is partially preserved, but the original sentiment regarding hidden bank accounts remains vague. The text is grammatically correct and fluent, though slightly less natural in its construction."
yeah they don t give a fuck .,Yes they don't care.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the vulgar expression 'give a fuck' and replaces it with a neutral alternative, 'don't care.' The core meaning of the original text is fully preserved, and the sentence is grammatically fluent and clear."
yeh well ban me fukkers fuck you morons,"Yes, ban me.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The toxic text contains vulgar language and insults, which have been successfully removed in the neutral text. However, the neutral text omits certain expressions, such as 'fukkers' and 'morons', which diminishes some of the original meaning and tone. The language in the neutral text is fluent and grammatically correct."
you have got to be insane .,you have got to be insane,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The toxic and neutral texts are identical, so no toxic content has been removed, resulting in a low Style Transfer Accuracy score of 0.0.

"Goths listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop. If you want you can find sources for every shit.","Goths listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop. If you want you can",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The toxic word 'shit' was completely removed, making the text more neutral.
