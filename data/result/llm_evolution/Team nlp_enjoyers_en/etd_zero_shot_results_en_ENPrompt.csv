any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,any of us who did half this would be locked up already.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: All toxic words (‘shit’, ‘the fuck’) have been removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so STA = 1.
CS: The core idea (that anyone who committed even half of these actions would already be in jail) is fully preserved. No factual information is lost, so CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable and reads smoothly, but “half this” is slightly ungrammatical; standard English would require “half of this.” Because of this minor fluency issue, FS = 0.5.
Joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
are they liars or just clueless ?,Are they liars or just clueless?,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The neutral text keeps the words ""liars"" and ""clueless,"" which are the very toxic/insulting terms present in the original. Therefore, no detoxification has occurred → score 0.
CS: Apart from capitalizing the first letter and tightening spacing, the sentence conveys exactly the same meaning, so core information is fully preserved → score 1.
FS: The sentence is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and punctuated. It reads smoothly with no errors → score 1."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .",i still say this guy is not a good person.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The toxic phrase ""piece of shit"" has been replaced with the neutral wording ""not a good person."" No other offensive language remains, so toxic content is fully removed – score 1.
CS: The core opinion (the speaker thinks the man is bad) is preserved, but the original sentence also conveys the speaker’s identity/background (""as someone from LA and an oilfield worker"") which is entirely omitted. Therefore only part of the meaning is retained – score 0.5.
FS: The sentence is understandable and grammatically correct overall, but it starts with a lowercase ""i,"" showing a minor capitalization error. This small issue slightly lowers fluency – score 0.5."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","calm down, cnn.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The phrase “the fuck” is the only toxic element in the source. It has been completely removed, leaving a neutral imperative, so STA = 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence still instructs CNN to calm down, preserving the addressee (CNN) and the core request. No important semantic content is lost, so CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is short, grammatical, and fully understandable. Although it starts with a lowercase letter, this is a very minor issue that does not hinder readability. Therefore FS = 1."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,China and Russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (0): The neutral text still contains the violent phrase ""use a big stick to smack trump around,"" so no toxic content has been removed.
Content Similarity (0.5): The subjects (China and Russia), the intended action (use a big stick), and the target (Trump) remain, but the entire conditional clause ""if those ships do anything foolish"" is missing, so only part of the original meaning is preserved.
Fluency (0): The sentence is truncated and ends with ""if those,"" leaving it grammatically incomplete and hard to read; this constitutes a serious fluency error.
Joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (0 + 0.5 + 0) / 3 ≈ 0.17."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,They rarely care about facts,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic slur ""cretins"" has been completely removed, producing a neutral sentence. Therefore, Style Transfer Accuracy is 1. 
CS: The essential proposition—‘these people rarely care about facts’—is fully retained. The pronoun ""They"" adequately refers to the same group, so no substantive information is lost. Content Similarity is 1. 
FS: The neutral sentence ""They rarely care about facts"" is grammatically correct, concise, and fully understandable. Hence Fluency is 1."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,do people actually believe this???,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element is the word ""shit"". The neutral text removes this word entirely, leaving no toxic or negative language, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from removing the profanity, the sentence keeps the full proposition (questioning whether people believe something). ""this"" in the neutral sentence refers to the same referent as ""this shit"" in the toxic sentence, so the core meaning is fully preserved, CS = 1.
FS: ""do people actually believe this???"" is grammatical and easy to read. While it starts with a lowercase letter and uses multiple question marks, these are minor stylistic issues and do not impede fluency. Therefore, FS = 1."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","dont you ever change one of my edits, or i will come to your",0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"Style Transfer Accuracy (0.5): The explicit violent phrase ""and I will cut you"" has been removed, so the strongest toxic element is gone. However, the remaining sentence ""don’t you ever change one of my edits, or I will come to your"" still carries an implicit threat and aggressive tone, therefore toxicity is only partially removed.
Content Similarity (0.5): The core situation (warning someone not to change an edit and threatening to come to them) is partly preserved, but important details (""house"" and the specific violent action ""cut you"") are missing, so some original meaning is lost.
Fluency (0.5): The text is mostly readable, but it ends abruptly at ""come to your"", leaving the sentence incomplete and ungrammatical. Capitalization and punctuation issues also exist, so fluency is acceptable but flawed.
Overall joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.5."
even bush knows he fucked up .,even bush knows he is bad,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The profane phrase ""fucked up"" has been completely removed and replaced with the neutral wording ""is bad."" There is no remaining profanity or slur, so STA = 1. CS: The original sentence states that Bush realizes he ""messed up"" (made a mistake). The neutral sentence states Bush realizes he ""is bad,"" shifting the meaning from acknowledging a specific failure to a judgment about his character. The negative sentiment is retained but the nuance is changed, so only partial preservation: CS = 0.5. FS: ""even bush knows he is bad"" is grammatically correct, easy to read, and free of errors aside from optional capitalization of ""Bush""; thus it is fluent: FS = 1. The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,popeyes for doing this in the first place,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The profanity “fuck” is completely removed, and no other toxic or offensive wording remains, so the style transfer accuracy is judged as 1.
CS: The sentence still refers to “popeyes” and the fact that they “did this in the first place,” so the basic factual content is retained. However, the original strong negative attitude toward Popeyes is lost, and the resulting phrase is not a full statement of blame. Therefore, only partial meaning is preserved → 0.5.
FS: The neutral output is understandable, but it is not a complete grammatical sentence (it lacks a main verb or subject-verb agreement such as “Damn Popeyes …” or “I blame Popeyes …”). This incomplete structure hurts readability, though it can still be deciphered → 0.5."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.0,"STA: The word ""ass"" (profanity) is still present, so no detoxification has been achieved → 0.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps most of the original idea (being beaten by GRE practice tests taught a lesson), but it is truncated and omits the final phrase ""mistake again,"" so part of the meaning is lost → 0.5.
FS: The sentence is readable up to the point it stops, but it ends abruptly at ""same,"" making it grammatically incomplete. It is still understandable, yet not fully fluent → 0.5."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,getting stronger every month yeah i wish.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element was the expletive ""fucking"", which has been completely removed. No other offensive or aggressive wording remains, so STA = 1.
CS: Aside from deleting the swear word, all lexical items and the overall meaning (expressing a wish that one were getting stronger every month) are preserved. Therefore CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable, but it lacks standard capitalization and clearer punctuation (e.g., a comma or period after ""month""). This minor grammatical roughness lowers readability slightly, so FS = 0.5.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
have you ever been to r trees and seen all the shit people say weed can do ? .,have you ever been to r trees and seen all the things people say weed can,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic word ""shit"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""things"", and no new toxic language was introduced, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1).
CS: The neutral sentence keeps almost all original information but drops the final verb ""do"", leaving the phrase ""weed can"" unfinished. This omission slightly alters the meaning and makes the statement less precise (score 0.5).
FS: The sentence is readable but grammatically incomplete due to the truncation at the end (""weed can""). This causes a noticeable fluency issue, though the gist is still understandable (score 0.5)."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .",a cop got fired?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic interjection “holy shit” has been completely removed, leaving a fully neutral sentence, so the style transfer accuracy is 1.
CS: The core proposition (questioning the fact that a police officer was fired) is fully preserved; only the expletive has been dropped, so content similarity is 1.
FS: “A cop got fired?” is short but fully grammatical and natural-sounding English; no fluency issues detected, so fluency is 1."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,How do you manage that?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity ('the fuck') was completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so score = 1.
CS: Apart from removing the profanity, the sentence still asks exactly the same question ('How do you manage that?'), so the original meaning is fully preserved, score = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, correctly capitalized, and fully fluent, score = 1."
how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,How do you think people afford houses and cars?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The obscene word ""fuck"" has been completely removed and no other offensive language remains, so the style is fully neutral (score 1).
CS: Aside from deleting the expletive, every informational element of the original question (asking how people can afford houses and cars) is preserved; the core meaning is intact (score 1).
FS: The sentence is well-formed, properly capitalized, and grammatically correct, making it fully fluent (score 1)."
i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,I accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost freak out.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The profanity ""shit my pants"" has been fully replaced with the neutral phrase ""freak out,"" and no other toxic language remains, so the detoxification is complete (score 1).
CS: All informational elements are kept: the speaker misread the title as ""laser machete"" and had a strong emotional reaction. The substitution of ""shit my pants"" with ""freak out"" conveys the same intensity of surprise/fear, so the core meaning is preserved (score 1).
FS: The sentence is understandable but contains a tense error (""almost freak out"" should be ""almost freaked out""). This slight grammatical flaw lowers fluency but does not impede comprehension (score 0.5)."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,I did not vandalize anything you did not do.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The offensive phrase ""you dick"" is completely removed, and no other toxic wording is present, so Style Transfer Accuracy = 1.
CS: The original sentence asserts a complete denial of vandalism (""I did not vandalize anything""). The neutral text changes this to ""I did not vandalize anything you did not do,"" which introduces a conditional qualifier and allows the possibility that the speaker vandalized things the interlocutor also vandalized. Hence only part of the core meaning is preserved → 0.5.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, capitalized, and easy to read, although slightly unnatural semantically; there are no clear grammatical errors. Therefore, Fluency = 1."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,i don't care about sides!.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The profane phrase ""give a flying fuck"" is replaced with the neutral expression ""don't care""; no toxic or abusive language remains, so the score is 1.
CS: Both sentences express the same proposition—indifference toward ""sides""—with no loss of core meaning, so the score is 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but has minor fluency issues: the lowercase ""i"" and the redundant punctuation ""!."". These small errors justify a 0.5 instead of 1."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,I have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (0): The supposed detoxified sentence keeps the explicit phrase ""to wipe my ass,"" which is the source of vulgarity in the original. No toxic or crude element has been removed, so the style has not been neutralised at all.
Content Similarity (1): The neutral sentence is almost a verbatim copy of the source (only capitalising the first word and dropping the final period). All information — having toilet paper and no shortage of food — is fully preserved.
Fluency (1): The sentence reads smoothly and is grammatically correct; the absence of a final period is a negligible punctuation issue that does not hinder comprehension. Therefore fluency is judged perfect.
Joint score: The arithmetic mean of the three sub-scores is (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but fucking seriously .,i mean it's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the profanity ""fucking"". The neutral sentence removes this word entirely and contains no new offensive language, so toxic content is fully eliminated → 1.
CS: The central idea—expressing that it is awesome that the pope is so cool—is preserved. The dropped tail phrase “and stuff but fucking seriously” adds emphasis but no substantive information. Therefore the core meaning remains intact → 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable and grammatically acceptable, but it ends rather abruptly without final punctuation and includes a slightly awkward repetition of the word “awesome.” These small issues lower overall fluency, hence 0.5 instead of 1.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","i sell quite a bit of stuff on there, and paypal has ",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic term ""shit"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""stuff"" and no other offensive language remains, so toxic content is fully removed → 1.
CS: The first clause (selling a lot on the platform) is preserved, but the sentence is cut off after ""paypal has"", omitting the crucial information ""actually helped me pay the bills."" Roughly half of the core meaning is lost → 0.5.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical up to the comma, but it ends abruptly, creating an incomplete sentence. It is still understandable but clearly ungrammatical and not fully fluent → 0.5."
"if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the shit out of him .","If hes found to have acted in cold blood, the feds are going",1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The toxic phrasing “persecute the shit out of him” has been entirely removed; no new offensive wording appears, so style transfer is fully successful (1).
CS: The rewritten sentence is truncated after “the feds are going,” omitting the action they will take. Because the main predicate is missing, the core proposition (that the feds will persecute/pursue him) is lost, so almost none of the original meaning is preserved (0).
FS: The output contains two issues: (1) it ends abruptly, forming an incomplete sentence, and (2) “hes” lacks the apostrophe. While the fragment is still partly understandable, these grammatical problems make the sentence noticeably non-fluent; thus fluency is judged as 0.5 rather than 0.
Overall, the joint score (average of the three dimensions) is (1 + 0 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.5."
it s a big deal because the school didn t give a shit until she was being bullied .,it s a big deal because the school didn't care until she,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The profanity 'didn't give a shit' has been replaced with the neutral phrase 'didn't care'. No other offensive wording remains, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1).
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the idea that it is a big deal because the school was indifferent. However, it truncates the clause 'until she was being bullied', ending after the word 'she'. Thus, part of the core information (the bullying trigger) is lost, giving only partial preservation (score 0.5).
FS: The text is almost correct up to 'didn't care', but it stops abruptly at 'until she', leaving the sentence incomplete. While the beginning is readable, the truncation is a noticeable grammatical error. It is still somewhat understandable, so it falls into the moderate category (score 0.5)."
"judging by the shit i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .","judging by the things i ve seen in my number years, number of those",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the word ""shit."" It has been replaced by the neutral word ""things,"" and no other offensive or aggressive language remains, so the toxic content is fully removed (score 1).
CS: The first clause (""judging by the … years"") is preserved, but the second clause (""spent with george w."") is completely dropped. Therefore, roughly half of the original meaning is missing, warranting a partial-preservation score of 0.5.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical up to ""number of those"" but then stops abruptly, leaving an incomplete thought. While the reader can still glean some meaning, the truncation creates a noticeable fluency error. Hence it is understandable yet flawed, giving a fluency score of 0.5.
Joint score: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.67."
"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up",it takes meminutes to resolve a page so you can fuck wikipedia up,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the insults “fucking tosser” and “cunts”, but still keeps the explicit phrase “fuck wikipedia up”, which is clearly toxic. Therefore the toxic style is only partially removed → 0.5.
CS: The key idea that it takes the speaker only minutes to fix a page so that the addressee can mess Wikipedia up is retained. However, the initial phrase “last warning” is dropped and the direct insults toward the addressee are gone, resulting in partial loss of original information → 0.5.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it has noticeable fluency problems: the word string “meminutes” lacks a space, the sentence has no capitalization, and overall wording feels awkward. These issues impede smooth reading but do not make the sentence incomprehensible → 0.5."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .",pants on fire justin,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"STA: The original toxicity lies in explicitly calling Justin a ""liar."" The detoxified sentence drops the word ""liar,"" but the idiom fragment ""pants on fire"" still implicitly references the childhood taunt ""liar, liar, pants on fire,"" so a mild toxic connotation remains. Hence partial, not complete, removal → 0.5.
CS: The core message—that something about Justin is associated with lying—remains only implicitly through the fragment ""pants on fire."" The explicit accusation ""liar"" is lost, and the sentence is shortened, so some meaning is preserved but some is lost → 0.5.
FS: ""pants on fire justin"" is understandable but ungrammatical: no capitalization, no verb, fragmentary structure. Readability is fair but not fully fluent → 0.5."
my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,My thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag ,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (0): The neutral sentence still contains the insult 'dirt bag'; no toxic language was removed or softened, so the toxic style remains unchanged.
Content Similarity (1): Apart from capitalization and the dropped period, the neutral sentence conveys exactly the same meaning and information as the original.
Fluency (1): The sentence is grammatically correct and easily understood. The absence of a final period is a minor punctuation issue that does not impede readability, so full fluency credit is given."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","No way number bricks fits in a car, this is bs ",0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicit profanity ""fucking"" has been removed, but the slang abbreviation ""bs"" (short for ""bullshit"") is still present and carries a toxic tone. Therefore, toxic content is only partially removed → 0.5.
CS: Aside from deleting the word ""fucking,"" every other word and the overall message (disbelief that a certain number of bricks can fit in a car and labeling it as nonsense) is fully preserved → 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it has noticeable grammatical issues: missing article/quantifier (""a"" or ""the"") before ""number,"" incorrect subject-verb agreement (""number bricks fits""), and it ends without proper punctuation. These issues reduce fluency, though the sentence is still readable → 0.5."
noones asking you to invade shit .,no one is asking you to invade things.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity word ""shit"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""things,"" leaving no toxic or offensive language. Hence full credit (1).
CS: The rewritten sentence conveys the same proposition: nobody is requesting that the listener invade anything. The substitution of ""things"" for the colloquial ""shit"" keeps the core meaning intact, so no meaningful information is lost (1).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, well-formed, and easily understandable. There are no punctuation, agreement, or wording problems (1)."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,not playing around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive word ""fucking"" has been fully replaced with the neutral word ""playing,"" so all toxic language is removed (score 1). CS: Aside from substituting one verb with a synonymous, non-toxic verb, the sentence structure and all informational content remain identical; the core meaning is entirely preserved (score 1). FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, clear, and natural-sounding; the only very minor issue is the lack of initial capitalization, which does not impede readability, so it is considered fully fluent (score 1)."
nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady as fuck .,nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during,1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The offensive wording ""shady as fuck"" is completely removed; the remaining text contains no profanity or slurs, so style transfer accuracy is 1.
CS: The neutral sentence is truncated after the word ""during,"" omitting the idea that the absence of footage makes the events look suspicious. Consequently, the core meaning is largely lost, so content similarity is 0.
FS: The sentence is grammatical up to a point but stops mid-phrase and therefore reads as incomplete. It is still partially understandable, but the truncation harms fluency, so fluency is 0.5.
Overall, the joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 0 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.5."
number will solve alot of fucking problems if it comes down to it .,number will solve alot of problems if it comes down to it.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element was the profanity ""fucking""; it has been completely removed, leaving neutral language, so score = 1.
CS: Aside from removing the swear word, all information (that an unspecified number will solve many problems if necessary) is preserved, so score = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it contains noticeable issues: starts with a lowercase word that should be an article plus noun (""A number""), and uses the non-standard spelling ""alot"". These grammatical/orthographic flaws lower fluency, so score = 0.5.
Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random shit like this .,org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random stuff like this.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only clearly toxic token in the source sentence is the word “shit.” In the neutral version it has been replaced with the neutral word “stuff,” eliminating the toxic tone entirely, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from that single lexical change, every other element (""org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random … like this"") is preserved. The message—that Wikipedia has articles on many random topics—remains identical, so CS = 1.
FS: The output is understandable, but it still contains informal/erroneous constructions: “org there s” should be “Org, there are” or “Org, there’s”; “there s” is missing the apostrophe; the overall sentence lacks a capital letter at the start and a period spacing issue. These minor grammatical problems lower fluency, hence FS = 0.5.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
"ouch man , them swedes were dicks to norway =\","ouch man, them swedes were bad to norway =\",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic slur ""dicks"" is replaced with the neutral word ""bad."" No other overtly toxic language remains, so the toxic content has been fully removed. 

CS: Besides substituting the insult, the sentence keeps all the original information: the speaker, the target (Swedes), the action (being bad/dicks) toward Norway, and even the emotive marker ""=\"". Core meaning is fully preserved. 

FS: The sentence is understandable, punctuation is acceptable, but the colloquial grammar ""them swedes"" and lowercase proper noun ""norway"" are errors that detract from full fluency. Therefore it is only partly fluent.

Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
people are idiots for wasting emergency call time on crap like this .,people are not smart for wasting emergency call time on crap like this.,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The word ""idiots"" (clearly toxic) was softened to ""not smart,"" which is non-toxic. However, the profanity ""crap"" remains, so toxicity is only partially removed ⇒ 0.5.
CS: The sentence still expresses the same idea—that it is unwise to waste emergency call time on trivial matters—so core meaning is preserved ⇒ 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fully understandable. Minor stylistic issue (lower-case initial ""people"") does not impede fluency ⇒ 1.
Joint score: (0.5 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
"quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some idiot hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .",quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some hierarch,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic element is the insult ""idiot."" In the neutral sentence this word is removed, and no new toxic wording appears, so toxic content has been fully eliminated – score 1.

CS: The neutral sentence keeps the main idea (saints were canonized for opposing a hierarch) but omits two pieces of information: (1) that the hierarch was killed for their opposition (""even unto being killed"") and (2) the example ""like st."" Therefore some core meaning is lost – score 0.5.

FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical and easy to read. Although ""some hierarch"" is slightly uncommon wording, it is acceptable and clear, with no errors impeding comprehension – score 1.

Joint score is the average: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
read your own fucking link .,read your own link,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element was the word ""fucking"", which has been completely removed; the rewritten sentence is neutral, so STA = 1.
CS: Aside from deleting the profanity, every content word (""read"", ""your"", ""own"", ""link"") is retained, so the directive and meaning are fully preserved. Therefore CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it lacks initial capitalization and a closing period, so it is not fully well-formed; thus it earns 0.5 rather than 1. The wording itself is otherwise correct."
same crap going on in the pnw too .,same crap going on in the pnw too.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The only potentially toxic word in the source is ""crap."" It remains unchanged in the neutral text, so no detoxification occurred → 0.
CS: Apart from removing an extra space before the period, the sentence is identical; all meaning is preserved → 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is short, grammatical, correctly punctuated, and easily understandable. While it starts with a lowercase letter, this is a stylistic rather than grammatical flaw, so fluency is considered fully acceptable → 1."
"shit , i d love an number pm sunset .",i d love an number pm sunset.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the expletive ""shit"". It has been completely removed and nothing in the rewritten sentence carries any offensive tone, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the swear word, every other word from the original sentence is retained. The core intent (the speaker would love a number at a certain PM sunset time) is unchanged, therefore CS = 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable but not fully fluent: it lacks proper capitalization and apostrophe (""i d"" instead of ""I'd""), uses the odd article ""an"" before ""number,"" and the phrase ""pm sunset"" is awkward. These issues hurt readability but do not render the sentence incomprehensible, so FS = 0.5."
some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped in the ass .,some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence has completely removed the toxic/hate‐inducing phrase “to get raped in the ass,” leaving a neutral description of the event, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1. 
CS: All non-toxic information from the source (the person, the robbery of a liquor store, the amount $400, and subsequent imprisonment) is retained. The only dropped content is the toxic phrase, which is not required to preserve factual meaning in detoxification, so Content Similarity is 1. 
FS: The rewritten sentence is fully comprehensible but shows minor fluency issues: it lacks initial capitalization and a final period. Because of these small grammatical lapses, Fluency is rated 0.5. 
The joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (1 + 1 + 0.5)/3 = 0.83."
"someone says no , and they say fuck off we need vets only for free housing ? .","someone says no, and they say fuck off we need vets only for",0.0,0.5,0.5,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA): The toxic expression ""fuck off"" is kept unchanged in the neutral sentence, so no real detoxification has taken place. Therefore STA = 0.
Content Similarity (CS): The first part of the message (""someone says no, and they say…"") is preserved, but the sentence is cut off after ""for,"" omitting the crucial information ""free housing"" and the final question mark. Hence only part of the original meaning remains ⇒ CS = 0.5.
Fluency (FS): Although the beginning is readable, the sentence ends abruptly with ""for,"" making it grammatically incomplete and awkward. It is still understandable but clearly not fluent ⇒ FS = 0.5.
Joint score: (0 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.33."
still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,still standing up for your leader who loves himself and nobody else.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic adjectives ""lying"" and ""crazy"" have been removed, leaving no overtly abusive or hateful language, so the detoxification is complete (score 1). CS: While most of the sentence is preserved, the specific claims that the leader is ""lying"" and ""crazy"" are part of the original proposition. Removing them changes the asserted qualities of the leader, leading to partial loss of meaning (score 0.5). FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and fully comprehensible; minor stylistic issues such as lowercase initial letter do not hinder readability (score 1). The joint score is the arithmetic mean of the three sub-scores: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
sucked like nothings ever sucked before .,Sucked like nothings ever sucked before.,0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The neutral sentence is virtually identical to the toxic sentence; the negative slang word ""sucked""—the source of toxicity—remains unchanged, so no detoxification occurred. CS: Because the sentences are identical in content, the original meaning is fully preserved. FS: The sentence is readable, but it contains a grammatical error (""nothings"" should be ""nothing's"") and is stylistically abrupt. Therefore, it is understandable yet not fully fluent, meriting 0.5."
taking a stand with either party is equally retarded .,taking a stand with either party is equally retarded.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The word ""retarded"" is an ableist slur and is still present in the neutral text. No toxic content was removed, so Style Transfer Accuracy = 0.
CS: The neutral text conveys exactly the same idea as the toxic text; no information has been lost or altered. Therefore Content Similarity = 1.
FS: The sentence is short, grammatical, and easy to understand. Aside from the lack of capitalization (which matches the original), there are no fluency issues. Thus Fluency = 1.
Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
that almost never happens excepts rarely in shit hole countries .,That almost never happens excepts rarely in bad countries.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive phrase ""shit hole"" is replaced with the neutral adjective ""bad,"" eliminating profanity and hateful tone, so toxic content is fully removed (score = 1). CS: Aside from the toned-down adjective, the sentence still expresses that the event almost never happens, except (rarely) in certain countries; no core information is lost (score = 1). FS: The sentence is understandable but has a grammatical error: ""excepts"" should be ""except."" This minor mistake affects fluency, so it is not fully fluent but remains readable (score = 0.5). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5)/3 ≈ 0.83."
their shit is cheap but its of such awful quality that you re better off getting the more expensive item .,their stuff is cheap but its of such bad quality that you re better off getting the,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The toxic word ""shit"" has been replaced by the neutral word ""stuff"", and no other offensive language remains, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1). CS: The core idea—cheap price but very poor quality, so you should buy something else—is mostly preserved, but the sentence drops the phrase ""more expensive item,"" losing a piece of information about what the speaker recommends buying. Hence partial preservation (score 0.5). FS: The rewritten sentence is mostly grammatical but ends abruptly with ""getting the,"" leaving it incomplete. Although the intended meaning can still be inferred, the truncation harms readability; thus it is only partially fluent (score 0.5)."
they need stop tratening people like morons .,they need stop tratening people like these people.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The toxic word ""morons""—the only explicit insult—has been removed and replaced with a neutral phrase. No other offensive language remains, so the transfer to a neutral style is complete (score 1). CS: The main idea that ""they should stop treating people in a certain negative way"" is partly kept, but replacing ""morons"" with ""these people"" changes the specific nuance (it is no longer clear that the treatment is condescending). Some semantic precision is lost, so only partial preservation (score 0.5). FS: The sentence is understandable but contains several problems: missing ""to"" after ""need,"" misspelled ""tratening"" (should be ""treating""), and the phrase ""like these people"" is awkward. These errors hinder smoothness but do not make the sentence incomprehensible (score 0.5). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.67."
they re both fucked up .,they re both bad,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic expression ""fucked up"" has been fully replaced with the non-toxic word ""bad,"" so all toxicity is removed → 1. 
CS: The sentence still conveys that both subjects are viewed negatively; the shift from ""fucked up"" to ""bad"" keeps the core meaning (negative evaluation of both) intact, only softening intensity, which is not core information → 1. 
FS: The sentence is clear and readable, but the contraction is written as ""they re"" instead of the correct ""they're,"" which is a grammatical error; therefore fluency is acceptable but not perfect → 0.5."
this guy is a total sellout with no brains for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking .,This guy is not a good person for business and lacks the ability of forward ,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the explicitly toxic insults “total sellout” and “no brains.” The remaining wording is negative but not abusive, so the style has been successfully detoxified (score 1).
CS: Core idea that the person is poor at business and lacks forward-thinking is partly kept, but the notion of being a “sellout” is omitted and the final phrase is truncated, so some meaning is lost (score 0.5).
FS: The sentence is mostly understandable, but the phrase “lacks the ability of forward” is grammatically incomplete, reducing fluency (score 0.5)."
"this is a joke , are you all fucking retards ? .","this is a joke, are you all retards?.",0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"Style Transfer Accuracy (0.5): The profanity “fucking” was removed, but the ableist slur “retards” remains, so toxicity is only partially reduced.
Content Similarity (1): Apart from deleting the word “fucking,” all information and intent of the original sentence are preserved, so meaning retention is complete.
Fluency (0.5): The sentence is understandable, but the punctuation “?.” at the end is ungrammatical, and the comma spacing is slightly awkward, so it is not fully fluent.
Joint score: The average of the three sub-scores is (0.5 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.67."
this is some twilight zone shit,this is some twilight zone thing,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element is the profanity ""shit"". It has been replaced with the neutral word ""thing"", so all toxicity is removed — score 1.
CS: The replacement of ""shit"" with ""thing"" keeps the intended meaning: the speaker is stressing how strange or surreal something feels (a ""Twilight Zone"" situation). No content or contextual information is lost — score 1.
FS: The neutral sentence ""this is some twilight zone thing"" is grammatical, coherent, and easy to read. No fluency issues are present — score 1."
this shit is overwhelming to think about .,This is overwhelming to think about,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive word ""shit"" has been removed, leaving a completely neutral sentence, so the style transfer is fully successful.
CS: The neutral sentence conveys the same idea—that the subject is overwhelming to think about—only dropping the vulgar intensifier. No core information is lost, so content similarity is complete.
FS: ""This is overwhelming to think about"" is a well-formed, grammatical sentence with correct capitalization and punctuation, hence fully fluent."
what an arse hole you are !,you are not a good person,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The obscene insult ""arse hole"" has been replaced with the neutral phrase ""not a good person"". No profane or hateful language remains, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1). CS: The original intent—telling the addressee they are a bad person—is kept. The strength is softened but the core meaning (“you are bad”) is intact, so content is fully preserved (score 1). FS: ""You are not a good person"" is a fluent, grammatical sentence. The only minor issue is the lowercase initial letter, which does not impair readability; overall fluency is perfect (score 1). Therefore the joint score is the arithmetic mean: (1+1+1)/3 = 1.0."
"whats the title of this report , no shit ? .",What is the title of this report?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The phrase ""no shit"" is the only toxic element in the source; it has been entirely removed, leaving a polite, neutral question, hence 1. CS: The neutral text still asks exactly the same question about the report’s title, preserving the full semantic content (no loss of core meaning), so 1. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, well-punctuated, and natural-sounding English, therefore 1."
why the fuck does everyone hate syria so much ? .,Why does everyone hate syria so much?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The explicit toxic word “fuck” has been completely removed and no other offensive language remains, so the detoxified sentence is fully neutral. CS: The question keeps the exact meaning of the original—asking why everyone hates Syria—so all core information is preserved. FS: The rewritten sentence is clear and readable, but it contains a minor grammatical error: the proper noun “Syria” should be capitalised. Because 1.0 requires no grammatical errors, fluency is scored 0.5. The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
why the fuck haven 't they condemned north korea ?,why haven 't they condemned north korea?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the swear word “fuck.” The neutral sentence removes this word entirely and contains no other aggressive or derogatory language, so toxicity is fully eliminated → 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the profanity, the sentence keeps every other word, maintaining the question about the lack of condemnation of North Korea. No factual or semantic information is lost → 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, fully understandable, and reads naturally. The minor token-spacing before the question mark and lowercase “north korea” are stylistic rather than grammatical errors and do not impede readability, so fluency is considered perfect → 1."
"yeah , comparitively fuck all because they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and smart accountants ? .","yeah, comparitively fuck all because they have loads of offshore",0.0,0.5,0.5,0.0,"STA: The neutral sentence keeps the explicit profanity ""fuck all"", so no detoxification occurred. According to the rubric this merits 0.
CS: The first half of the meaning (that comparatively it is very little because they have lots of offshore …) is retained, but the mention of ""hidden bank accounts and smart accountants"" is dropped, so only partial preservation → 0.5.
FS: The rewritten sentence is readable but contains a spelling error (""comparitively""), still has profanity, and ends abruptly after ""offshore"", making it syntactically incomplete. Understandable yet flawed → 0.5."
yeah they don t give a fuck .,Yeah they don't care,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity ""fuck"" was entirely removed and replaced with a neutral expression; no toxic wording remains, so score = 1.
CS: ""They don't give a fuck"" and ""They don't care"" convey the same core meaning—complete preservation, so score = 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is short, grammatical, and fully understandable; no fluency problems are present, so score = 1."
yeh well ban me fukkers fuck you morons,yeh well ban me ban me,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"Style Transfer Accuracy: The neutral sentence removes all offensive words ('fukkers', 'fuck you', 'morons'), leaving no toxic language, so STA = 1.
Content Similarity: The central idea—challenging the addressee to ban the speaker—is retained, but the insults, which are part of the original semantic content, are omitted. Therefore only partial meaning is preserved, so CS = 0.5.
Fluency: The neutral text is understandable, but it lacks proper capitalization, punctuation, and contains a redundant repetition ('ban me ban me'), making it somewhat awkward. Hence FS = 0.5.

you have got to be insane .,you have got to be insane,0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The neutral sentence keeps the exact insulting phrase ""you have got to be insane""; no toxic content is removed, so the score is 0.  CS: The meaning is fully preserved because the sentence is identical (minus the period), so the score is 1.  FS: The sentence is understandable and grammatical in structure, but it lacks end punctuation and retains the same lower-case start, which counts as minor correctness issues; therefore fluency is scored at 0.5 rather than 1."
"Goths listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop. If you want you can find sources for every shit.","Goths listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop. If you want you can find",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic element was the profanity ""shit""; it has been removed and no new toxic language is introduced, so toxicity is fully eliminated (score 1).
CS: The first sentence is preserved exactly, but the second sentence is truncated (""If you want you can find"") and no longer conveys the idea that sources can be found for everything. Because part of the original meaning is lost, similarity is only partial (score 0.5).
FS: The first sentence is fluent. The second sentence, however, is an incomplete clause lacking an object, which makes the overall text somewhat awkward but still understandable. This merits a partial fluency score (0.5)."
I hate free speech it is shit.,I hate free speech it is bad.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The explicit profanity ""shit"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""bad."" No slurs or profanity remain, so the toxic element is fully removed → 1.
CS: The statement still conveys the speaker's strong dislike of free speech and the negative judgment about it. No core information has been added or lost → 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it is not fully grammatical; it should read ""I hate free speech; it is bad"" or use a conjunction. The run-on structure lowers fluency slightly → 0.5.

"Minority Breeder Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page started for him, nice job dipshit.",Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page ,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The insults ('dipshit') and potentially derogatory 'Minority' tag have been entirely removed; the rewritten sentence is neutral, so STA = 1.
CS: The main idea—that Breeder is an important person and that the interlocutor deleted his page—remains, but the clause ""started for him"" and the qualifier ""Minority"" (a factual descriptor rather than toxicity) are omitted. Hence some information is lost, so CS = 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical and easy to understand (""Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page.""); no major errors, therefore FS = 1."
"This bot is seriously driving us crazy This image exists, I must kill it!","This bot is seriously driving us crazy This image exists, I must kill it",0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The neutral text still contains the violent phrase ""I must kill it"" and the aggressive tone of ""driving us crazy."" No toxic content was actually removed, so STA = 0.
CS: The neutral text is virtually identical to the original (minus an exclamation mark). All information and meaning are fully preserved, so CS = 1.
FS: The sentence lacks proper punctuation between clauses and sounds awkward, though it is understandable. Because of these grammatical issues, FS = 0.5.

Have you been fucking living under a rock?,Have you been living under a rock?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The single toxic element, the swear word ""fucking"", has been entirely removed, resulting in a fully neutral sentence, so the score is 1.
CS: All semantic content is preserved; the question and its rhetorical implication are unchanged except for the profanity. Hence, the score is 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and reads naturally with no errors, so fluency receives a 1."
"I will do Whatever i want and it is my right, what is both of yous Problem Asshole.","I will do Whatever i want and it is my right, what is both of you",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the explicit insult ""Asshole"" and uses no other toxic or aggressive term, so toxicity is fully eliminated (score 1).
CS: The main assertion ""I will do whatever I want and it is my right"" is preserved, but the clause ""what is both of yous problem"" is truncated to the incomplete phrase ""what is both of you,"" losing the idea of asking about the other parties’ problem. Therefore, only partial meaning is retained (score 0.5).
FS: The sentence is understandable but not fully grammatical: inconsistent capitalisation (""Whatever i""), missing apostrophe in ""it's,"" and the ending ""what is both of you"" is ungrammatical and feels cut off. These issues hinder fluency but do not make the text unintelligible (score 0.5)."
How the hell are you going to block me from editting?,How are you going to block me from editting?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The phrase “the hell” is the sole toxic element. It has been entirely removed, leaving a fully neutral sentence, so score = 1.
CS: The sentence still asks how the interlocutor will block the speaker from editing, preserving all core meaning. Minor wording change is only the removal of profanity, so score = 1.
FS: The sentence is clearly understandable and grammatically fine, but it retains the misspelling “editting” (should be “editing”). This minor error slightly harms fluency, so score = 0.5."
WTF How The Fuck Does This Person Merit A Page On Wikipedia.,WTF How Does This Person Merit A Page On Wikipedia.,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA: The phrase ""the fuck""—a clear toxic/profane element—has been removed, but the remaining interjection ""WTF"" is itself an abbreviation of the same profanity, so toxicity is only partially eliminated. CS: Aside from deleting the swear words, all informational content (expressing disbelief that the person deserves a Wikipedia page) is fully preserved. Therefore content similarity is complete. FS: The sentence is understandable, but starting with the standalone acronym ""WTF"" without punctuation and ending with a period instead of a question mark makes it slightly ungrammatical. Hence fluency is adequate but not flawless."
"I'm retired, fuckers, leave me alone.","I'm retired, leave me alone.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit slur 'fuckers' was removed, and no other toxic language remains, so toxic content is fully eliminated (score 1).
CS: Apart from deleting the insult, all factual content (speaker is retired and wants to be left alone) is preserved, so the core meaning is entirely maintained (score 1).
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and perfectly readable: 'I'm retired, leave me alone.' No fluency issues (score 1)."
This profile has protected Bermender since day fukkin ONE.,This profile has protected Bermender since day ONE.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element is the expletive 'fukkin', which has been completely removed. The resulting sentence contains no offensive language, so STA = 1.
CS: All informational content—subject ('This profile'), action ('has protected'), object ('Bermender'), and temporal phrase ('since day ONE')—is fully retained. No core meaning is lost, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and easily readable. Capitalizing 'ONE' is a stylistic choice that does not hinder fluency. Therefore, FS = 1.
The joint score is the average of the three subscores: (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1.0."
"Please carry on, so everyone can see what an ignorant arse you are.","Please carry on, so everyone can see what you are.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicitly toxic phrase ""ignorant arse"" has been entirely removed, and the rewritten sentence is neutral in tone. Therefore, Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: Apart from eliminating the insult, the sentence still conveys the same intention (encouraging the person to continue so that others can judge them). No non-toxic informational content is lost, so Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear and reads naturally: ""Please carry on, so everyone can see what you are.""  Hence Fluency is 1."
I drive a Subaru Legacy and I'm a conservative But I still think you're an idiot.,I drive a Subaru Legacy and I'm a conservative But I still,1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The neutral text has removed the explicit insult (“idiot”) and contains no other toxic wording, so the toxic style is fully eliminated (score 1).
CS: The original sentence asserts that the speaker still thinks the listener is an idiot. In the neutral version everything after “I still” is missing, so the main proposition (that the speaker still thinks something about the listener) is lost. Therefore the core meaning is not preserved (score 0).
FS: The sentence fragment ends abruptly with “I still,” leaving it grammatically incomplete. While the words present are understandable, the text is clearly ungrammatical and reads awkwardly. This merits a partial fluency score (0.5).
Overall, the joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 0 + 0.5)/3 = 0.5."
"Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be an arse hole","Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be an unpleasant person.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit insult ""arse hole"" is replaced with the milder phrase ""unpleasant person,"" removing the obscene/toxic element. No toxic language remains, so STA = 1. 
CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys the same core message (addressing Greenman and stating that, as usual, he is considered disagreeable). The sentiment and structure are preserved, so CS = 1. 
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, correctly punctuated, and easy to read. Hence FS = 1."
"You're not an admin, so shut the fuck up faggot.","You're not an admin, so shut up.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic elements are fully removed—both the profanity ""fuck"" and the slur ""faggot"" are gone. The remaining phrase ""shut up"" is assertive but generally considered non-toxic conversational language, so the output is neutral (score 1).
CS: All substantive information is preserved: the statement that the person is not an admin and the directive to be quiet remain intact. Only abusive wording is removed, so the core meaning is unchanged (score 1).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and reads naturally: ""You're not an admin, so shut up."" No errors or awkwardness are present (score 1)."
"Yes, the wikipedia page, like I just mentioned, dumbass.","Yes, the wikipedia page, like I just mentioned, is not useful.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic word ""dumbass"" has been completely removed and no new offensive language is introduced, so Style Transfer Accuracy = 1.
CS: Both sentences refer to the Wikipedia page previously mentioned, so that core context is retained. However, the neutral version adds new semantic content (""is not useful"") that was not present in the original, thereby altering the original intent. Thus, only partial meaning preservation → CS = 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, coherent, and easy to read with no evident errors → FS = 1."
"oh shit, nooooo, is someone going to spank me now?","nooooo, is someone going to spank me now?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element was the profanity ""shit."" It has been completely removed, resulting in a fully neutral sentence, so the score is 1.
CS: The essential proposition—expressing dismay (‘nooooo’) and asking whether someone will spank the speaker—remains intact. The removed profanity does not carry unique semantic content beyond emphasis, so core meaning is preserved; score 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, coherent and easily readable. While it begins with a lowercase word and has an elongated “nooooo,” this is stylistic and does not harm fluency; score 1."
steak Diane Please stop fucking up my edits on steak diane. Thank you.,Please stop up my edits on steak diane. Thank you.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The offensive term ""fucking"" is entirely removed, leaving no overtly toxic or profane language, so detoxification is complete (1.0).
CS: The original request was ""Please stop messing/fucking up my edits."" The neutral text becomes ""Please stop up my edits,"" which keeps the idea of asking someone to stop doing something to the speaker's edits, but the verb phrase ""stop up"" no longer clearly conveys ""messing up."" Core intent is partially preserved, but meaning is degraded (0.5).
FS: The sentence is readable, but ""stop up my edits"" is ungrammatical/awkward English. While still comprehensible, it contains a noticeable fluency error (0.5)."
You amins are such bastards.,You amins are such mean people.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit slur ""bastards"" has been replaced with the neutral phrase ""mean people,"" completely removing the toxic content, so STA = 1.  CS: The sentence still conveys the original core message—addressing the same group (""amins"") and expressing a negative opinion about them—so the semantic content is essentially preserved, earning CS = 1.  FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and easy to understand; no fluency issues are present, therefore FS = 1."
"Quit Defacing my user page, you ugly cunt.-","Quit Defacing my user page, you ugly person.-",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The most offensive slur ""cunt"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""person"", which removes the strongest toxic element. However, the phrase still includes the direct insult ""ugly"", so the sentence retains some toxicity. Therefore, the transfer is only partially successful → 0.5.
CS: Apart from substituting the slur, all information is preserved: the speaker tells someone to stop defacing their user page and still calls them ugly. Core meaning remains intact → 1.
FS: The sentence is grammatical and easily readable. Although capitalization of ""Defacing"" and the trailing dash are slightly unusual, they do not hinder comprehension → 1.
Joint score: (0.5 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
I forgot to mention the even sadder cunt that is,I forgot to mention the even worse person that is.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive slur “cunt” is fully removed and replaced by the neutral word “person,” so the sentence is free of toxic language (score 1). CS: The rewritten sentence keeps all core information: the speaker still says they forgot to mention someone and expresses a negative judgment about that person (changing 'sadder' to 'worse' doesn’t alter the main meaning). Hence full preservation (score 1). FS: The sentence is understandable but remains grammatically awkward; the trailing phrase “that is.” is incomplete and sounds ungrammatical, mirroring the fragmentary structure of the original. Therefore, only partial fluency (score 0.5). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
Randi was born a DICK.,Randi was born a mean person.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive word ""DICK"" is completely replaced by the neutral phrase ""mean person,"" so no toxic content remains (score 1).
CS: Calling someone a ""dick"" means they are unpleasant or mean; the neutral sentence conveys the same idea that Randi is an unkind person, so the core meaning is preserved (score 1).
FS: The sentence is understandable and grammatically acceptable, but the expression ""was born a mean person"" is somewhat awkward and uncommon; a more natural phrasing would be ""Randi is a mean person"" or ""Randi was born mean."" Because of this mild awkwardness, fluency is rated 0.5.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83"
This is your last warning; stop being an asshole.,This is your last warning; stop being mean.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit insult ""asshole"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""mean,"" so all toxic language is removed. CS: The neutral version keeps the entire structure and message (a final warning and a request to change behavior), so the core meaning is fully preserved. FS: The sentence is grammatically correct and perfectly readable; no fluency issues are present."
"MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize, so fuck you.","I do not vandalize, so please stop.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the explicit profanity (""fuck you"") and aggressive capitalization, replacing it with the polite phrase ""please stop"". No toxic language remains, so the score is 1. 
CS: The original message contains two ideas: (1) the speaker claims the right to say what they want on their user page, and (2) they state they do not vandalize and insult the other person. The neutral version keeps idea (2) (""I do not vandalize"" + a request to stop) but completely drops idea (1) about the user page and freedom of speech. Therefore, some core information is lost, giving a partial preservation score of 0.5. 
FS: The rewritten sentence is concise, grammatically correct, and easy to read. No awkward phrasing or errors, so fluency is 1."
I am Nancy and I like to fuck up people's fun.,I am Nancy and I like to mess up people's fun.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The obscene phrase “fuck up” was replaced with the neutral phrase “mess up,” eliminating profanity and toxic tone, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1). CS: Aside from the profanity substitution, every word and the overall proposition (‘Nancy likes to spoil other people’s fun’) is preserved, so the core meaning is entirely retained (score 1). FS: The sentence is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and fully fluent (score 1). Therefore, the average joint score is 1.0."
"Heh, look, not EVERYTHING is on google. you are a dumbass.","Heh, look, not EVERYTHING is on google. you are a ",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic word ""dumbass"" has been removed and no other offensive term remains, so toxic content is completely neutralized => 1.0.
CS: The first sentence (""Heh, look, not EVERYTHING is on google."") is fully preserved, but the second sentence is truncated to ""you are a"", so the speaker’s evaluative statement about the interlocutor is lost. About half of the original meaning is kept => 0.5.
FS: The text is partly fluent; the first sentence reads well, but the second sentence is incomplete and lacks a noun after ""a"", plus it starts with a lowercase letter. These issues hurt readability though the text is still understandable => 0.5."
Thanks for being an ass when I tried to help.,Thanks for not helping when I tried to help.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The explicit insult ""ass"" has been completely removed, and no other toxic or profane language is present, so the detoxification is fully successful (1.0).
CS: The original sentence criticizes the other person for being rude (""being an ass"") while the rewritten sentence criticizes them for simply ""not helping."" The sarcastic thanks and the context of the speaker having tried to help are preserved, but the specific notion of rudeness is replaced with lack of assistance. Thus only part of the core meaning survives (0.5).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and natural-sounding with no noticeable errors, so fluency is high (1.0)."
"You're a fucking moron, go read the notability guidelines.","You're not smart, go read the notability guidelines.",0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA: The offensive phrase ""fucking moron"" has been softened to ""not smart,"" which removes the explicit profanity and slur-level insult. However, it still contains a direct personal insult, so the sentence is not fully neutral. Therefore, partial removal of toxicity → 0.5.
CS: The revised sentence keeps both propositions: (1) the speaker’s negative judgment of the addressee’s intelligence and (2) the instruction to read the notability guidelines. Meaning is fully preserved → 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable and largely grammatical, but the comma splices two independent clauses; a period or semicolon would be preferable (""You're not smart. Go read …""). Minor fluency issue → 0.5."
Some bubble tea for you! thanks ass hole,Some bubble tea for you! Thanks,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The phrase “ass hole,” which constitutes the toxic element, has been completely removed. The resulting sentence is entirely neutral, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the toxic insult, the neutral text keeps the main informational content: offering bubble tea and expressing thanks. Since loss of the toxic wording is an intended style change rather than semantic loss, the core meaning is preserved, so CS = 1.
FS: “Some bubble tea for you! Thanks” is grammatical, clear, and natural. No awkward phrasing or errors are present, so FS = 1.
Overall, all three dimensions score the maximum, giving a joint score of 1.0."
And your dumb people fell for his shenanigans.,And your people fell for his shenanigans.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral text eliminates the only toxic element, the adjective ""dumb,"" leaving no offensive language, so it fully succeeds in detoxification (score 1).
CS: Apart from removing the insult, all propositional content (that the listener’s people were deceived by someone’s shenanigans) is preserved. Detaching the toxic modifier does not alter the factual meaning, so content similarity is fully maintained (score 1).
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and easy to read. No awkward phrasing or errors are present (score 1)."
These people are INSANE.,These people are crazy.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The toxic adjective 'INSANE' was simply replaced by another derogatory adjective 'crazy'. The sentence is still insulting and therefore not neutral. No effective detoxification occurred → 0.
CS: The core meaning (speaker judges the people as mentally unsound) is fully preserved. No information was lost → 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatically correct and fully understandable → 1."
Did you know that you are an ugly piece of shit?,Did you know that you are an ugly person?,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.25,"STA: The phrase “piece of shit,” which is overtly toxic, has been removed, but the sentence still directly insults the addressee by calling them “ugly.” Because a significant portion of the toxicity remains, this counts as only a partial detoxification → 0.5.
CS: The rewritten sentence still communicates that the speaker is telling the addressee they are ugly, preserving the main meaning. However, it omits the stronger negative judgment contained in “piece of shit,” so some semantic content is lost → 0.5.
FS: “Did you know that you are an ugly person?” is fully grammatical and easy to read, with no awkward phrasing → 1.
Joint score is the arithmetic mean of the three sub-scores: (0.5 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 ≈ 0.67."
Be careful who you call a moron.,Be careful who you call a moron.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The toxic term ""moron"" remains unchanged, so the text is still offensive; no detoxification occurred, leading to a score of 0. CS: The neutral text is identical to the original, thus the core meaning is fully preserved, warranting a score of 1. FS: The sentence is grammatically correct and fully fluent, so it receives 1. The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
"Yeah, you can fuck off incel.","Yeah, you can fuck off incel.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The so-called neutral text is identical to the toxic input, still containing the insults ""fuck off"" and ""incel."" No detoxification has occurred, so the score is 0.
CS: Because the sentence is unchanged, every bit of original meaning is preserved, so the score is 1.
FS: The sentence is short, grammatically correct, and perfectly understandable (profanity does not affect grammatical fluency). Therefore, the fluency score is 1.
Joint score: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
"Stop defending pedophiles, faggot.",Stop defending pedophiles.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the slur “faggot,” which is the sole toxic element in the source; the remaining words are not inherently hateful or slur-based. Hence, toxic content is fully removed (score 1).
CS: The directive to “Stop defending pedophiles” — the core informational content — is completely preserved. Only the abusive slur is omitted, which does not alter the intended request. Therefore, meaning retention is complete (score 1).
FS: The neutral text is short, grammatically correct, and perfectly readable with no awkward phrasing (score 1)."
"No one is vandalizing assholes, so get it straight!!!","No one is vandalizing these people, so get it straight!!!",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The insulting word ""assholes"" has been replaced by the neutral phrase ""these people,"" eliminating the explicit toxic content. The remaining wording is assertive but not profane or hateful, so toxic content has been fully removed → 1. 
CS: Aside from swapping the insult for a neutral descriptor, the sentence still communicates exactly the same message about no one vandalizing a group and urging the listener to understand. Core information is fully preserved → 1. 
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and easily readable; multiple exclamation points are stylistic but not ungrammatical. Overall fluency is intact → 1."
"DUDE CALM THE FUCK DOWN!!!
",DUDE CALM THE FUCK DOWN!!!,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The toxic word ""FUCK"" remains unchanged in the neutral text, so no detoxification has occurred (score 0). CS: The neutral text conveys exactly the same message and emphasis as the original—nothing is added or omitted (score 1). FS: The sentence is short, grammatically correct, and fully understandable; uppercase shouting does not create grammatical errors, so it is considered fluent (score 1). Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
"Some jackass vandalized the article again, can someone fix it?","Some person vandalized the article again, can someone fix it?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy: The only toxic element ""jackass"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""person,"" eliminating insulting language completely, so STA = 1.

Fluency: The revised sentence is grammatically correct and reads naturally with no awkward phrasing, giving FS = 1.
Joint score is the mean of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1.0."
I'm afraid I can't verify it as his myspace account has been deleted I fucking hate you.,I'm afraid I can't verify it as his myspace account has been,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The toxic phrase ""I fucking hate you"" has been completely removed and no new toxic wording was introduced, so the text is fully neutral.

CS: The neutral sentence keeps the main idea that the speaker cannot verify something because of the status of the My- space account, but it drops the word ""deleted,"" leaving the sentence incomplete. Although the hate expression is rightly omitted (it is not required to preserve toxicity), the loss of the word ""deleted"" removes part of the factual information. Therefore, only partial meaning is preserved → 0.5.

FS: The text is grammatical until the end but stops abruptly at ""has been,"" resulting in an unfinished clause. The reader can still infer the intended meaning, yet the truncation harms fluency. Thus it is understandable but imperfect → 0.5.

Joint score: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.67."
He deserves every beating and rape he will be subjected to.,He deserves every beating and rape he will be subjected to.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA): The neutral text is identical to the toxic text; none of the hateful or violent content was removed, so STA = 0.
Content Similarity (CS): Because the sentence is unchanged, the meaning is fully preserved, so CS = 1.
Fluency (FS): The sentence is short, grammatical, and fully understandable, so FS = 1.
Joint score is the arithmetic mean: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
