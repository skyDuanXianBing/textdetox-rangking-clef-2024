any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,any of us who did half this would be locked up already.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the vulgar expressions 'shit' and 'the fuck' and replaces them with more neutral language, making the tone completely non-toxic, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the phrase 'half this' is less specific than 'half this shit', leading to a slight loss of meaning or emphasis on negative actions, resulting in partial content similarity. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with no issues in readability or expression."
are they liars or just clueless ?,Are they liars or just clueless?,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text without any modification, so the toxic content (accusatory terms 'liars' and 'clueless') remains unchanged, resulting in a Style Transfer Accuracy score of 0.0. The original meaning is fully preserved, hence Content Similarity is 1.0. The sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, earning a Fluency score of 1.0."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .",i still say this guy is not a good person.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the highly offensive expression 'piece of shit' and replaces it with the mild and neutral 'not a good person', achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the original speaker's strong negative sentiment and emphatic tone—reinforced by their identity as an oilfield worker from LA—are significantly weakened, leading to partial loss of the original meaning. The core judgment about the person remains, but the intensity and contextual emphasis are diminished. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with natural language flow."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","calm down, cnn.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'the fuck' is successfully removed and replaced with a neutral imperative 'calm down', resulting in completely neutral language. The core meaning of urging CNN to calm down is fully preserved without any loss of information. The neutral text is grammatically correct, concise, and fluent, with no expression or readability issues."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,China and Russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The neutral text is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence, failing to fully detoxify the original toxic content. As a result, it does not achieve style transfer, loses all core meaning due to incompleteness, and is not fluent or readable. Therefore, it scores 0 in all dimensions."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,They rarely care about facts,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the offensive term 'cretins' and replaces it with a more neutral implied subject, achieving complete detoxification. However, the original phrase 'cretins like this' specifically refers to a certain type of person with contempt, while the rewritten version 'They rarely care about facts' is vague and loses the referential specificity, resulting in partial meaning loss. The language in the neutral text is grammatically correct and fluent, with no issues in readability."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,do people actually believe this???,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The toxic term 'shit' has been completely removed and replaced with punctuation ('???'), resulting in a neutral expression, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the removal of 'this shit' slightly alters the original meaning, as 'shit' carries a derogatory connotation toward the content being questioned, which is now underemphasized, leading to partial loss of meaning. The neutral text remains fluent and grammatically correct, with natural use of punctuation to convey skepticism. Therefore, content similarity is partially preserved."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","dont you ever change one of my edits, or i will come to your",0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The neutral text partially removes the explicit threat ('i will cut you') by cutting off the sentence, but the remaining fragment ('i will come to your') still implies a threatening intent, so toxic content is only partially removed (STA = 0.5). However, the core meaning of the original sentence — the conditional threat in response to someone changing an edit — is severely disrupted because the consequence is omitted, leading to significant meaning loss (CS = 0.0). Additionally, the neutral text ends abruptly and is syntactically incomplete, making it difficult to understand and grammatically incorrect (FS = 0.0)."
even bush knows he fucked up .,even bush knows he is bad,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the profane language ('fucked up') and replaces it with a milder expression ('is bad'), achieving complete style transfer to a neutral tone. However, the phrase 'is bad' is a significant oversimplification and does not fully capture the nuance of admitting a mistake or error in judgment implied by 'fucked up,' resulting in partial loss of original meaning. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with no issues in readability or structure."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,popeyes for doing this in the first place,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the profanity ('fuck') and expresses the sentiment in a completely non-toxic way, achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the removal of the expletive also results in a partial loss of emotional intensity and speaker attitude present in the original, which may be part of the core meaning, leading to a moderate reduction in content similarity. The output is grammatically correct and fluent, though slightly less natural due to the abrupt beginning without a subject or verb, but still understandable as a fragment. Thus, fluency remains high."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The neutral text does not successfully detoxify the original sentence—it retains the informal and potentially vulgar expression 'getting my ass kicked' without replacement, so no meaningful style transfer has occurred (STA: 0.0). The neutral text is also incomplete, cutting off mid-sentence ('i never make this same'), resulting in significant loss of core meaning and making it impossible to fully interpret the intended message (CS: 0.0). Furthermore, the truncation leads to a grammatically incomplete and incoherent sentence, severely impacting readability and fluency (FS: 0.0). Overall, the detoxification attempt fails on all three dimensions."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,getting stronger every month yeah i wish.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'i fucking wish' is successfully rewritten as 'i wish', removing the profanity while maintaining a neutral tone. The core meaning of skepticism or sarcasm about getting stronger every month is preserved, as the emotional nuance is still conveyed through context without offensive language. The neutral text is grammatically correct, natural, and fully fluent. All criteria are fully satisfied."
have you ever been to r trees and seen all the shit people say weed can do ? .,have you ever been to r trees and seen all the things people say weed can,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"The neutral text removes the vulgar term 'shit' and replaces it with the more neutral 'things', successfully eliminating the toxic language, hence STA is 1.0. However, the neutral text is cut off at the end ('weed can'), resulting in an incomplete sentence and loss of core meaning, leading to a CS score of 0.5 due to significant but not total information loss. The fluency is impaired because the sentence is grammatically incomplete and abruptly ends, making it less readable, so FS is 0.5. The joint score is the average of the three: (1.0 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.67, but following the pattern in Example 3 where similar issues received 0.83, this reflects a slightly more generous interpretation considering partial fluency and meaning preservation despite truncation."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .",a cop got fired?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the expletive 'holy shit' and converts the expression into a neutral tone, achieving full style transfer accuracy. The core idea of a cop being fired is preserved, but the emotional emphasis and surprise conveyed by the original interjection are lost, leading to partial content similarity. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with no language errors. Thus, fluency is fully maintained."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,How do you manage that?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'how the fuck' is appropriately replaced with the neutral 'how', effectively removing the profanity while maintaining the original meaning of the question. The core intent—expressing surprise or skepticism about someone's ability to achieve something—is preserved. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent. Therefore, all three dimensions receive the highest score."
how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,How do you think people afford houses and cars?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'how the fuck' is successfully replaced with the neutral 'how', completely removing the profanity while maintaining a natural tone. The core meaning regarding questioning how people afford houses and cars is fully preserved. The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, with no degradation in language quality. This represents a perfect style transfer with full content retention and high fluency."
i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,I accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost freak out.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the vulgar expression 'shit my pants' and replaces it with the milder 'freak out', achieving complete detoxification and neutral tone (STA: 1.0). The core idea of an intense reaction due to a misreading is preserved, but 'freak out' is less specific and slightly weakens the intensity and humor of the original phrase, leading to partial meaning preservation (CS: 0.5). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and natural-sounding, with no fluency issues (FS: 1.0)."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,I did not vandalize anything you did not do.,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the offensive term 'you dick' and replaces it with a grammatically correct and neutral expression, achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the meaning is significantly altered: the original statement is a defensive retort denying vandalism and insulting the addressee, while the rewritten version says 'you did not do,' which introduces a completely different and confusing subject. This results in a complete loss of core meaning, warranting a CS score of 0. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, so fluency receives a full score."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,i don't care about sides!.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'don't give a flying fuck' is successfully replaced with the neutral 'don't care', effectively removing the vulgar language while maintaining a completely neutral tone. The core meaning of indifference toward 'sides' is fully preserved without any loss of information. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and fluent. This represents a perfect detoxification according to the ETD framework."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,I have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text, but the original sentence does not contain overtly toxic language such as insults, profanity, or hate speech. It expresses a factual personal circumstance (having toilet paper and sufficient food) without aggression or offensiveness. Therefore, no detoxification was necessary, and the output appropriately retains the original meaning and fluency. The style is already neutral, so the transfer accuracy is complete, content similarity is fully preserved, and the sentence is grammatically correct and fluent."
i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but fucking seriously .,i mean it's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'fucking seriously' which carries a negative and vulgar tone, replacing it with a clean cutoff that avoids offensive language, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the removal of the phrase slightly alters the original sentiment, which expressed a mix of admiration and exasperation; this nuance is lost, leading to partial content similarity. The remaining text is grammatically correct and fluent, with no language errors, so fluency is fully preserved."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","i sell quite a bit of stuff on there, and paypal has ",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"The toxic term 'shit' is successfully replaced with the neutral word 'stuff', effectively removing the vulgar language and achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the neutral text is incomplete ('and paypal has'), resulting in a partial loss of the original meaning, particularly the clause about PayPal helping to pay the bills, which diminishes content similarity. The fluency is affected due to the sentence being cut off mid-phrase, making it grammatically incomplete and slightly disruptive to readability, though the portion that is present is otherwise natural and clear. Thus, both content similarity and fluency are scored as 0.5."
"if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the shit out of him .","If hes found to have acted in cold blood, the feds are going",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The neutral text fails to complete the sentence, cutting off mid-phrase ('the feds are going'), which results in a complete loss of the original meaning and makes the output unintelligible. While the beginning of the sentence does not contain overtly toxic language beyond the informal 'persecute the shit out of him', which could be considered mildly vulgar, the rewritten version does not clearly rephrase this expression, but more critically, the output is severely truncated. This leads to a 0 for Content Similarity because the core consequence (punishment intensity) is lost, and a 0 for Fluency due to the incomplete, nonsensical structure. However, since no toxic content remains in the fragment, and assuming the intent was to remove the vulgar emphasis, Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 as the output does not contain any toxic expressions."
it s a big deal because the school didn t give a shit until she was being bullied .,it s a big deal because the school didn't care until she,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"The neutral text removes the vulgar expression 'didn't give a shit' and replaces it with the more neutral 'didn't care', successfully eliminating toxic language, so STA is 1.0. However, the neutral text is cut off prematurely ('until she'), resulting in an incomplete thought and loss of core information about the bullying context, leading to partial meaning preservation (CS = 0.5). Additionally, the truncation causes a grammatical and structural issue, making the sentence feel incomplete and slightly disrupting readability, hence FS = 0.5 despite otherwise correct grammar up to the point of cutoff."
"judging by the shit i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .","judging by the things i ve seen in my number years, number of those",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text removes the vulgar term 'shit' and replaces it with the more neutral 'things', successfully eliminating toxic language, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the original sentence is cut off mid-phrase ('number of those spent with george w.') and the neutral version ends abruptly at 'number of those', resulting in a partial loss of core meaning—specifically omitting the reference to 'George W.'—which diminishes content similarity. Despite this truncation, the portion that is present is grammatically correct and fluent, with no language errors, so fluency is fully preserved."
"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up",it takes meminutes to resolve a page so you can fuck wikipedia up,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text partially removes toxic content by retaining the phrase 'you can fuck wikipedia up', which still contains vulgar language and is not fully neutralized. However, the insult 'fucking tosser' and 'cunts like you' were removed, indicating partial detoxification. The core meaning is preserved as the warning about quick page resolution and user-caused damage to Wikipedia remains intact. The language is fluent and grammatically correct, with no structural or syntactic issues."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .",pants on fire justin,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text removes the insulting term 'liar' and the repetitive emphatic expression 'liar, liar', resulting in completely neutral language, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, by omitting 'liar, liar' entirely and keeping only 'pants on fire justin', the core meaning is partially lost—while 'pants on fire' implies lying, the intensity and repetition of the original insult are not preserved, leading to a moderate loss in content similarity. The output is grammatically correct and fluent, though slightly fragmentary, but still natural in informal speech. Hence, fluency is fully maintained."
my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,My thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag ,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text, with only the period at the end removed, so the toxic content 'dirt bag' remains unchanged. Therefore, no effective style transfer has been performed, resulting in an STA score of 0.0. The original meaning is fully preserved, earning a CS score of 1.0. The sentence is grammatically correct and readable, so FS is 1.0. However, since the offensive term is not mitigated, the detoxification task has failed in its primary objective."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","No way number bricks fits in a car, this is bs ",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"The toxic word 'fucking' was removed, but the neutral text retains the informal and potentially dismissive expression 'bs', which can still be interpreted as derogatory or unprofessional. Therefore, toxic content is only partially removed, resulting in an STA score of 0.5. The core meaning about disbelief that number bricks fit in a car is fully preserved, so CS is 1.0. The sentence is grammatically correct and readable, with only minor stylistic informality, so FS is 1.0."
noones asking you to invade shit .,no one is asking you to invade things.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully replaces the informal and potentially aggressive expression 'shit' with the more neutral and appropriate word 'things', effectively removing any toxic or vulgar connotation. The core meaning of the sentence — that no one is demanding or expecting an invasion — is fully preserved. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, with only a minor correction of 'noones' to 'no one' improving readability. The language remains natural and contextually appropriate, meeting all criteria for style transfer accuracy, content similarity, and fluency."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,not playing around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'fucking around' is successfully replaced with the neutral and equivalent phrase 'playing around', effectively removing the vulgar language while maintaining a completely neutral tone. The core meaning of the sentence is fully preserved, as 'playing around' conveys the same sense of casual or unserious engagement as the original slang. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and fluent, with no issues in readability or expression. Therefore, all three dimensions receive the highest score."
nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady as fuck .,nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The neutral text appears to be a truncation of the original toxic text and does not complete the sentence. While the remaining portion does not contain toxic language (satisfying STA), the core meaning is completely lost due to the absence of the concluding phrase (hence CS = 0.0). Additionally, the output is grammatically incomplete and not readable as a standalone sentence, resulting in FS = 0.0. The detoxification fails in both content preservation and fluency despite removing the potentially offensive expression ('shady as fuck')."
number will solve alot of fucking problems if it comes down to it .,number will solve alot of problems if it comes down to it.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic word 'fucking' has been successfully removed, resulting in a completely neutral expression. The core meaning of the sentence is fully preserved, as the emphasis on the effectiveness of 'number' in solving problems remains intact. The neutral text is grammatically correct and fluent, with no issues in readability or language quality."
org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random shit like this .,org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random stuff like this.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic term 'shit' is successfully replaced with the neutral term 'stuff', effectively removing any vulgar language while maintaining a completely neutral tone. The core meaning of the sentence is fully preserved, as 'random stuff' conveys the same informal generality as 'random shit'. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and fluent, with no issues in expression or readability. Therefore, all three dimensions receive the highest score."
"ouch man , them swedes were dicks to norway =\","ouch man, them swedes were bad to norway =\",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"The original toxic text uses 'dicks' as a derogatory term toward Swedes, which is partially mitigated by replacing it with 'bad' in the neutral version. However, 'bad' is vague and does not fully eliminate the negative connotation in a sufficiently neutral way, leaving some residual toxicity; thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 0.5. The core meaning—expressing disapproval of how Swedes treated Norwegians—is preserved, so Content Similarity is 1.0. The neutral text is grammatically correct and readable, with natural language flow, earning a Fluency score of 1.0."
people are idiots for wasting emergency call time on crap like this .,people are not smart for wasting emergency call time on crap like this.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic term 'idiots' has been successfully replaced with the more neutral 'not smart', which removes the insulting tone while maintaining the critical intent. The core meaning—that people are making poor choices by misusing emergency calls—is preserved without distortion. The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent. Therefore, all three dimensions receive full scores."
"quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some idiot hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .",quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some hierarch,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the potentially disrespectful term 'idiot' and the incomplete, emotionally charged reference to martyrdom ('even unto being killed, like st.'), resulting in a fully neutral tone. Thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0. However, the core meaning is partially lost: the original emphasizes opposition to an 'idiot hierarch' and implies moral courage unto death, which is truncated and weakened in the neutral version. This constitutes a meaningful reduction in informational content, warranting a CS score of 0.5. The neutral text is grammatically correct and readable, so Fluency is 1.0. The joint score is the average: (1.0 + 0.5 + 1.0) / 3 = 0.83."
read your own fucking link .,read your own link,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic word 'fucking' is successfully removed and replaced with neutral language, resulting in a completely non-toxic expression. The core meaning of urging someone to read their own link is fully preserved without any loss of information. The neutral text is grammatically correct, concise, and fluent. This represents a perfect style transfer with no degradation in content or fluency."
same crap going on in the pnw too .,same crap going on in the pnw too.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text, with no modification to the potentially offensive term 'crap', which retains its vulgar connotation. Therefore, no detoxification has occurred, resulting in an STA score of 0.0. However, the original meaning is fully preserved (CS = 1.0) and the sentence is grammatically correct and fluent (FS = 1.0)."
"shit , i d love an number pm sunset .",i d love an number pm sunset.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The toxic word 'shit' is successfully removed, resulting in a completely neutral expression, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. The core intent of expressing a desire for a number at pm sunset is preserved, but the expletive may have carried emotional emphasis that is lost in the neutral version, leading to a partial reduction in content similarity. The neutral text is grammatically correct and fluent, with no language errors. Overall, the rewrite is effective but slightly underrepresents the original emotional tone."
some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped in the ass .,some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the vulgar and degrading expression 'to get raped in the ass', replacing it with a more neutral and appropriate ending by stopping at 'goes to prison', thus achieving complete style transfer to a neutral tone. However, the original sentence includes a consequential and emotionally charged outcome (prison rape) that is completely omitted in the rewritten version, leading to partial loss of the original meaning, particularly the implied harshness of prison life. Despite this omission, the core event (a poor person robbing a liquor store and facing prison) is preserved. The language in the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent with no issues in readability. Therefore, Content Similarity is scored 0.5 due to meaning truncation, while Style Transfer Accuracy and Fluency both receive full scores."
"someone says no , and they say fuck off we need vets only for free housing ? .","someone says no, and they say fuck off we need vets only for",0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The neutral text only truncates the original toxic sentence instead of properly rewriting it, leaving the offensive phrase 'fuck off' intact, so toxic content is not fully removed (STA = 0.5). The original meaning is severely disrupted because the sentence is cut off mid-thought ('we need vets only for'), resulting in incomplete and incoherent content (CS = 0.0). The output is not a complete sentence and lacks grammatical closure, making it difficult to understand (FS = 0.0). Overall, this is a failed detoxification attempt due to incomplete rewriting."
still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,still standing up for your leader who loves himself and nobody else.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic descriptors 'lying' and 'crazy' and replaces them with a more neutral characterization, resulting in completely non-toxic language (STA: 1.0). However, removing these attributes alters the original speaker's strong negative judgment about the leader, which was central to the original sentiment, leading to partial loss of meaning (CS: 0.5). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent (FS: 1.0)."
sucked like nothings ever sucked before .,Sucked like nothings ever sucked before.,0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"The neutral text fails to remove the toxic content, as the phrase 'sucked like nothings ever sucked before' retains vulgar and offensive language without mitigation, resulting in an STA score of 0.0. The core meaning is fully preserved, hence CS is 1.0. However, the capitalization at the beginning is inconsistent with standard sentence formatting, and the phrase 'nothings' should be 'nothing's' (contraction for 'nothing has'), indicating minor grammatical issues, leading to an FS score of 0.5."
taking a stand with either party is equally retarded .,taking a stand with either party is equally retarded.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text, with the offensive term 'retarded' left unchanged, which fails to remove the toxic content. Therefore, Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 0.0. The original meaning is fully preserved since no actual rewriting was done, resulting in a Content Similarity score of 1.0. The sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, earning a Fluency score of 1.0."
that almost never happens excepts rarely in shit hole countries .,That almost never happens excepts rarely in bad countries.,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"The toxic expression 'shit hole countries' is partially mitigated by replacing it with 'bad countries', which reduces offensiveness but still retains a vague negative connotation without fully achieving a neutral tone; thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 0.5. The core meaning—referring to certain countries where rare events might occur—is preserved, so Content Similarity is 1.0. However, the neutral text contains a grammatical error ('excepts rarely' should be 'rarely except'), which affects readability and fluency, leading to a Fluency score of 0.5."
their shit is cheap but its of such awful quality that you re better off getting the more expensive item .,their stuff is cheap but its of such bad quality that you re better off getting the,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"The neutral text successfully removes the vulgar term 'shit' by replacing it with the more neutral 'stuff', achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the neutral text is cut off mid-sentence ('getting the'), resulting in incomplete content and loss of the original's full meaning, which impacts content similarity. Additionally, the truncation causes a fluency issue, making the sentence feel incomplete and slightly awkward to read, though the portion that is present is grammatically correct. Thus, both content similarity and fluency are partially compromised."
they need stop tratening people like morons .,they need stop tratening people like these people.,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The toxic text contains the derogatory term 'morons', which should be neutralized. The neutral text attempts to remove this by replacing it with 'these people', but the phrase 'tratening people like these people' is incoherent and fails to convey a clear meaning, resulting in partial removal of toxicity (STA = 0.5). However, the core meaning of treating people in a condescending or foolish manner is lost due to vague substitution, leading to almost no preservation of original content (CS = 0.0). Additionally, the neutral text contains a spelling error ('tratening' instead of 'treating') and uses 'these people' redundantly and unclearly, making the sentence grammatically flawed and difficult to understand (FS = 0.0)."
they re both fucked up .,they re both bad,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The toxic expression 'fucked up' is successfully replaced with the neutral term 'bad', effectively removing the vulgar language and achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, 'bad' is a significant generalization that loses the intensity and specific connotation of 'fucked up', which implied serious psychological or emotional dysfunction; thus, core meaning is partially preserved but with notable dilution. The neutral text is grammatically correct and fluent, with no issues in readability or expression."
this guy is a total sellout with no brains for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking .,This guy is not a good person for business and lacks the ability of forward ,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"The neutral text removes the toxic and derogatory language such as 'total sellout' and 'no brains for business' by replacing them with the milder 'not a good person for business,' which successfully eliminates the offensive tone, warranting a full score for Style Transfer Accuracy. However, the original meaning is partially lost—the strong criticism about lack of business acumen and strategic thinking is weakened and less specific, resulting in a Content Similarity score of 0.5. Additionally, the neutral text appears to be cut off mid-sentence ('lacks the ability of forward'), making it incomplete and slightly ungrammatical, which affects readability and fluency, leading to a Fluency score of 0.5. Despite the incomplete ending, the portion that is present is understandable."
"this is a joke , are you all fucking retards ? .","this is a joke, are you all retards?.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text fails to remove toxic content, as the term 'retards' remains unchanged and is still a derogatory slur. Although the word 'fucking' was removed, the core insult is preserved, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 0.0. The original meaning is fully maintained, earning a Content Similarity score of 1.0. The sentence is grammatically correct and readable, so Fluency is 1.0."
this is some twilight zone shit,this is some twilight zone thing,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'shit' is successfully replaced with the neutral term 'thing', completely removing the vulgar language while maintaining a natural tone. The core meaning of expressing something strange or surreal (referencing 'Twilight Zone') is fully preserved. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with no issues in readability or expression."
this shit is overwhelming to think about .,This is overwhelming to think about,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic word 'shit' has been successfully removed and replaced with a neutral expression 'This', resulting in completely non-toxic language.

what an arse hole you are !,you are not a good person,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the offensive term 'arse hole' and replaces it with the more neutral 'not a good person', achieving full style transfer accuracy. The core sentiment of criticism is preserved, but the specific intensity and personal insult are softened, leading to partial meaning preservation—hence a CS score of 0.5.

why the fuck haven 't they condemned north korea ?,why haven 't they condemned north korea?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'why the fuck' is appropriately simplified to 'why' by removing the profanity while retaining the core interrogative intent. The neutral text successfully eliminates all toxic language, resulting in a completely neutral tone. The meaning of questioning the lack of condemnation toward North Korea is fully preserved without any significant alteration or information loss. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, concise, and fluent, with no syntactic or stylistic issues. Therefore, all three dimensions receive the highest score."
"yeah , comparitively fuck all because they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and smart accountants ? .","yeah, comparitively fuck all because they have loads of offshore",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The neutral text is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence ('yeah, comparitively fuck all because they have loads of offshore'), failing to provide a full detoxified version. As a result, toxic content (e.g., 'fuck') is not removed, meaning Style Transfer Accuracy is 0. The original meaning is not preserved due to the truncation, so Content Similarity is 0. The output is also not a complete sentence and contains a fragment, making it non-fluent with serious structural issues, hence Fluency is 0."
yeah they don t give a fuck .,Yeah they don't care,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'don't give a fuck' is successfully replaced with the neutral and equivalent phrase 'don't care', effectively removing the vulgar language while maintaining a completely neutral tone.

However, the core meaning is only partially preserved—the original expression conveys anger and defiance toward being banned, while the rewritten version loses much of the emotional and contextual nuance, reducing it to a repetitive and somewhat ambiguous statement. Despite this, the output is grammatically correct and fluent, with no structural or linguistic errors, resulting in a fluency score of 1.0."

Therefore, no effective style transfer has occurred, resulting in an STA score of 0.0. However, the original meaning is fully preserved (CS = 1.0), and the sentence is grammatically correct and fluent (FS = 1.0)."
"Goths listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop. If you want you can find sources for every shit.","Goths listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop. If you want you can find",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"The neutral text removes the vulgar term 'shit' by omitting the phrase entirely, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy as the remaining language is neutral. However, the content similarity is reduced because the original intent to suggest that sources are readily available for trivial or controversial claims is partially lost due to the abrupt truncation. Fluency is affected because the sentence is cut off mid-thought ('you can find'), resulting in an incomplete and grammatically incorrect structure, though the beginning of the text remains understandable. Therefore, while the style transfer is successful, both content preservation and fluency are partially compromised."
I hate free speech it is shit.,I hate free speech it is bad.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic word 'shit' is successfully replaced with the neutral term 'bad', effectively removing the vulgar expression while maintaining completely neutral language. The core meaning of the speaker disliking free speech and considering it negative is fully preserved. The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, with no degradation in language quality. Therefore, all dimensions receive the highest score."
"Minority Breeder Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page started for him, nice job dipshit.",Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page ,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text removes the toxic term 'Minority' and the insult 'dipshit', resulting in completely neutral language, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the phrase 'Minority Breeder' appears to be a specific identifier or title, and removing 'Minority' alters the specificity of the subject, leading to partial loss of core information. The content similarity is therefore reduced, though the main action (deleting the page of a significant person) is preserved. The neutral text is grammatically correct and fluent, despite being slightly truncated, and remains fully understandable. Hence, fluency is not compromised."
"This bot is seriously driving us crazy This image exists, I must kill it!","This bot is seriously driving us crazy This image exists, I must kill it",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text fails to remove toxic content, as the phrase 'I must kill it' retains a violent and threatening expression, which is clearly toxic. Therefore, Style Transfer Accuracy is 0.0. However, the meaning is fully preserved (CS: 1.0) and the text is fluent with no grammatical errors (FS: 1.0), though the detoxification attempt is essentially nonexistent as the output is nearly identical to the input, merely removing an exclamation mark without altering the toxic intent."
Have you been fucking living under a rock?,Have you been living under a rock?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'fucking' is successfully removed and replaced with a neutral version of the sentence without altering the meaning.

"I will do Whatever i want and it is my right, what is both of yous Problem Asshole.","I will do Whatever i want and it is my right, what is both of you",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"The neutral text removes the explicit insult 'Asshole', successfully eliminating the toxic content, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the original sentence is cut off at 'what is both of you', resulting in a loss of completeness and coherence, which reduces content similarity as the full intent and meaning of the question is not preserved. Additionally, the abrupt truncation introduces a grammatical issue and makes the sentence feel incomplete, affecting fluency. While the first part remains fluent, the incomplete ending lowers the overall fluency score to 0.5."
How the hell are you going to block me from editting?,How are you going to block me from editting?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'How the hell' is effectively neutralized to 'How', removing the expletive while maintaining the original intent of questioning the justification for being blocked from editing.

WTF How The Fuck Does This Person Merit A Page On Wikipedia.,WTF How Does This Person Merit A Page On Wikipedia.,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text partially removes toxic content by eliminating 'The Fuck' but retains 'WTF' at the beginning, which is still an abbreviation of a profane expression and carries a vulgar tone. Therefore, the style transfer is incomplete, resulting in a 0.5 score for Style Transfer Accuracy. The core meaning is fully preserved—questioning the justification for someone having a Wikipedia page—so Content Similarity is 1.0. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and readable, with no fluency issues, warranting a Fluency score of 1.0."

Therefore, all three dimensions receive the highest score."
"Please carry on, so everyone can see what an ignorant arse you are.","Please carry on, so everyone can see what you are.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the offensive term 'ignorant arse' and replaces it with the vague 'what you are,' making the language completely neutral and achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the core meaning is partially lost, as the original intent to highlight the person's ignorance and foolishness is weakened due to over-generalization. The neutral sentence remains grammatically correct and fluent, with no language errors, so fluency is fully preserved."
I drive a Subaru Legacy and I'm a conservative But I still think you're an idiot.,I drive a Subaru Legacy and I'm a conservative But I still,1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"The neutral text removes the toxic expression 'you're an idiot' by omitting it, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy with neutral language. However, the core meaning of the original sentence — expressing a critical opinion despite personal background — is lost due to the incomplete sentence, resulting in a content similarity score of 0. The fluency is partially affected because the sentence is cut off abruptly, making it syntactically incomplete and slightly awkward, hence a 0.5 fluency score."

"Yes, the wikipedia page, like I just mentioned, dumbass.","Yes, the wikipedia page, like I just mentioned, is not useful.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The original toxic term 'dumbass' is successfully replaced with the neutral and non-insulting phrase 'is not useful', effectively removing the offensive language and achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the replacement slightly alters the intended emphasis: 'dumbass' targets the person's intelligence or attitude, while 'is not useful' shifts the criticism to the Wikipedia page itself, which may not fully preserve the speaker's original intent. Thus, content similarity is partially preserved. The neutral text is grammatically correct and fluent, with natural language flow."
"oh shit, nooooo, is someone going to spank me now?","nooooo, is someone going to spank me now?",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.25,"The phrase 'oh shit' is a mild expletive that contributes to the overall tone but is not severely toxic; removing it would improve neutrality, but it was not addressed in the neutral text. However, the remaining phrase 'is someone going to spank me now?' retains a sarcastic and potentially provocative tone, which may imply mockery or passive-aggressiveness, thus not fully achieving a neutral style. Therefore, only partial progress is made in style transfer. Regarding content similarity, the core expression of exaggerated fear or sarcasm is preserved, but the emotional emphasis from 'oh shit, nooooo' is weakened by removing 'oh shit', leading to some loss of original intent. The neutral text is grammatically correct and fluent, with no language errors, hence full fluency score."
steak Diane Please stop fucking up my edits on steak diane. Thank you.,Please stop up my edits on steak diane. Thank you.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the profanity 'fucking' and converts the expression into a polite request, achieving complete style transfer to a neutral tone. However, the phrase 'stop up my edits' is grammatically incorrect or awkward—it should likely be 'stop interfering with my edits' or similar—resulting in partial loss of the original meaning, hence the CS score of 0.5. Despite this, the intent to request cessation of edit interference is still discernible. The output is otherwise fluent and grammatically acceptable, with only minor phrasing issues, so FS is 1.0."

The core message — asking someone to stop defacing a user page — is preserved, but the replacement slightly softens the intensity of the personal criticism, leading to a partial loss in meaning as the original insult carried strong emotional weight that is diminished.

The core idea of referring to someone negatively is preserved, but the intensity and emotional connotation are significantly softened, leading to a partial loss of the original emphatic and critical tone—hence, content similarity is scored 0.5. The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, maintaining natural language flow. Overall, the rewrite is effective in detoxification but slightly generalizes the original sentiment."
Randi was born a DICK.,Randi was born a mean person.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The toxic term 'DICK' is successfully replaced with the neutral and non-offensive phrase 'mean person', effectively removing the vulgar and insulting language, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the original phrase 'born a DICK' carries a strong derogatory connotation that implies inherent negative character, while 'born a mean person' is milder and less emphatic, resulting in some loss of the original intensity and nuance—hence partial content similarity. The neutral text is grammatically correct and fluent, with natural language flow. Overall, the rewriting is effective but slightly underrepresents the original's emphatic judgment."

However, the original statement 'MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT' expresses a strong assertion of autonomy that is completely omitted in the neutral version, resulting in partial loss of core meaning. Despite this omission, the key claim of not vandalizing is preserved. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent. Therefore, STA and FS are scored 1.0, while CS is 0.5 due to the omission of the user's assertion of control over their page."

However, the neutral text is incomplete ('you are a'), leading to a complete loss of core meaning in the second sentence, resulting in a Content Similarity score of 0.

However, the original meaning is partially altered: the toxic text expresses gratitude sarcastically for someone being unhelpful or rude, while the neutral version changes the focus to the person not helping, which simplifies and slightly distorts the original sentiment.

Thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0. However, 'not smart' is a softer and less emphatic expression than the original, which diminishes the intensity and potentially alters the speaker's intended emphasis, leading to partial meaning preservation (CS = 0.5). The neutral text remains grammatically correct and clear, with no fluency issues, so Fluency is 1.0. The joint score is the average: (1.0 + 0.5 + 1.0) / 3 = 0.83."

However, by removing 'dumb', the revised sentence loses some of the original evaluative emphasis on the perceived lack of intelligence or gullibility of the people, leading to partial meaning loss. The core event — people being deceived by shenanigans — is preserved, but the speaker's critical attitude is softened. The output is grammatically correct and fluent, with no language errors."
These people are INSANE.,These people are crazy.,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text replaces the capitalized 'INSANE' with 'crazy', which reduces the intensity slightly but does not fully remove the negative and potentially toxic connotation. 'Crazy' is still a stigmatizing term when referring to people, so the language remains somewhat derogatory, resulting in a partial detoxification (STA = 0.5). The core meaning is preserved accurately, as both versions convey strong disapproval or disbelief toward 'these people', so content similarity is high (CS = 1.0). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and natural-sounding, so fluency is fully maintained (FS = 1.0)."
Did you know that you are an ugly piece of shit?,Did you know that you are an ugly person?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the highly offensive term 'piece of shit' and replaces it with the more neutral 'person', achieving complete detoxification and making the language fully acceptable. Thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0. However, the original insult 'ugly piece of shit' carries a strong emotional and derogatory intensity that is significantly softened by simply saying 'ugly person', which downplays the severity of the attack. This results in partial preservation of meaning, warranting a Content Similarity score of 0.5. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural, so Fluency is 1.0. The joint score is the average of the three: (1.0 + 0.5 + 1.0) / 3 = 0.83."

"Stop defending pedophiles, faggot.",Stop defending pedophiles.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the offensive term 'faggot', resulting in completely neutral language, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the original sentence contains two distinct elements: condemning the defense of pedophiles and a personal attack ('faggot').
