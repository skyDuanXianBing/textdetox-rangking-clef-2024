any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,any of us who did half this would be locked up already.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'the fuck' while preserving the original meaning and tone of the sentence. The phrase 'did half this shit' is replaced with 'did half this', which softens the language without altering the core message. The resulting sentence is completely neutral in style, meeting the criteria for a score of 1 in Style Transfer Accuracy. The meaning remains intact—any person doing half of the described actions would be imprisoned—so Content Similarity is also 1. The revised sentence is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and free of errors, warranting a Fluency score of 1. All three dimensions are fully satisfied, resulting in a joint score of 1."
are they liars or just clueless ?,Are they liars or just clueless?,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text: 'Are they liars or just clueless?'. While the sentence is grammatically correct and fluent (FS = 1) and fully preserves the original meaning (CS = 1), it still contains a derogatory implication by calling people 'liars' and 'clueless', which are accusatory and potentially toxic expressions. Since no effort was made to remove or soften the toxic content, the Style Transfer Accuracy is 0. The output fails to transform the style into a genuinely neutral tone, thus no detoxification has occurred."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .",i still say this guy is not a good person.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1 because the neutral text successfully removes the highly toxic expression 'a piece of shit' and replaces it with the non-toxic 'not a good person,' resulting in a completely neutral tone. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core sentiment of disapproval toward the person is preserved, the neutral version omits key contextual details from the original—specifically, the speaker's identity as someone from LA and an oilfield worker—which contributes to a partial loss of meaning. Fluency (FS) is scored 1 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fully readable without any language issues. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","calm down, cnn.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text 'calm the fuck down, cnn.' contains a profane expression ('the fuck') which is successfully removed in the neutral text 'calm down, cnn.' without introducing any new toxic content, achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning—urging CNN to calm down—is preserved entirely, with only the profanity removed, so content similarity is fully maintained (CS = 1). The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, showing no fluency issues (FS = 1). Therefore, all three dimensions receive the highest score, resulting in a joint score of 1."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,China and Russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 0.5 because the neutral text retains the aggressive metaphor 'use a big stick to smack trump around', which is a toxic expression implying violent or hostile action. While it does not add new toxicity, it fails to fully remove the original toxic tone. Content Similarity (CS) is 0.0 because the neutral text is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence ('if those'), resulting in a complete loss of the original conditional meaning involving the ships' actions. The core information about consequences for 'foolish' actions by ships is entirely missing. Fluency (FS) is 0.0 because the output is grammatically incomplete and cannot be understood as a coherent sentence. The truncation makes it impossible to interpret the intended message, leading to severe readability issues."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,They rarely care about facts,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic term 'cretins like this', which carries a derogatory and insulting tone, and replaces it with a more neutral 'They', resulting in completely non-toxic language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core idea—that a certain group does not care about facts—is preserved, the original text specifically refers to 'cretins like this', which identifies a particular type of person (likely those being criticized for ignorance or irrationality). This specificity is lost in the neutral version, leading to some meaningful information loss. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence 'They rarely care about facts' is grammatically correct, clear, and fully natural in expression."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,do people actually believe this???,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the offensive word 'shit', which is effectively removed in the neutral text by replacing it with punctuation ('???'). The resulting sentence 'do people actually believe this???' is completely neutral in tone and free of any toxic language, satisfying the Style Transfer Accuracy criterion (score: 1). The core meaning—expressing disbelief or skepticism about whether people believe something—is fully preserved; only the profanity is removed, not the intent or message (score: 1 for Content Similarity). The neutral text is grammatically correct, natural, and easily understandable, with no fluency issues (score: 1 for Fluency). All criteria are fully met, resulting in a joint score of 1."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","dont you ever change one of my edits, or i will come to your",0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 0.5 because the neutral text partially removes the toxic content—the explicit threat 'i will cut you' is removed, but the remaining phrase 'i will come to your house' still carries an implicit threat, which is potentially toxic. Thus, the language is not completely neutral. Content Similarity (CS) is 0.5 because while the first part of the sentence is preserved, the removal of the final clause results in a significant loss of the original intent and emotional intensity, though the core idea of a warning is partially retained. Fluency (FS) is 0.5 because the neutral text is grammatically correct but ends abruptly without completing the thought, making it feel incomplete and awkward, though still understandable. The joint score is the average of the three: (0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.5."
even bush knows he fucked up .,even bush knows he is bad,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the profane expression 'fucked up' and replaces it with the non-toxic phrase 'is bad', resulting in completely neutral language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general idea that Bush acknowledges a negative outcome is preserved, the original phrase 'fucked up' implies a clear admission of a serious mistake or failure, whereas 'is bad' is vaguer and less specific, leading to some loss of the original meaning. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and readable with no language errors."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,popeyes for doing this in the first place,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic expletive 'fuck' has been completely removed and the resulting sentence contains no toxic language, achieving a neutral tone. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core subject (Popeyes and their action) is preserved, the emotional intensity and intent of criticism or blame in the original utterance are significantly weakened or lost by removing the expletive without any compensatory neutral expression (e.g., 'I'm disappointed in'). Thus, some meaning is lost. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, syntactically complete, and fully readable despite being a fragment. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1)/3 = 0.83."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 0 because the neutral text does not remove the toxic expression 'getting my ass kicked'; it remains unchanged and is still present in the output, which is a vulgar and aggressive phrase. Content Similarity (CS) is 0 because the neutral text is incomplete—it cuts off mid-sentence ('i never make this same')—and thus fails to preserve the full meaning of the original sentence. Fluency (FS) is 0 because the neutral text is grammatically incomplete and abruptly ends, making it difficult to understand. As a result, all dimensions receive the lowest score due to failure in detoxification, meaning preservation, and linguistic completeness."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,getting stronger every month yeah i wish.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the profane expression 'fucking wish,' which contributes a strong emotional intensity but is not essential to the core meaning. The neutral text replaces 'i fucking wish' with 'i wish,' effectively removing the profanity and rendering the language completely neutral, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning—expressing a hopeful sentiment about getting stronger every month—remains intact, with no loss of key information, so content similarity is fully preserved (CS = 1). The neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and free of any linguistic errors, resulting in perfect fluency (FS = 1). The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
have you ever been to r trees and seen all the shit people say weed can do ? .,have you ever been to r trees and seen all the things people say weed can,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA): The toxic word 'shit' has been replaced with the neutral term 'things', effectively removing the offensive language. The resulting text is completely neutral, so STA is scored 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS): The core idea—referring to claims about weed on r trees—is preserved, but the sentence is cut off at the end ('can'), resulting in incomplete meaning and loss of information. This partial preservation justifies a CS score of 0.5. For Fluency (FS): The neutral text is mostly understandable but ends abruptly, making it syntactically incomplete and awkward. This constitutes a grammatical issue that affects readability, warranting a score of 0.5. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.6667."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .",a cop got fired?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the expletive 'holy shit', which is a clear expression of surprise with emotionally charged, informal language. The neutral text removes this phrase entirely and retains only the core factual statement: 'a cop got fired?'. The resulting sentence is completely neutral in tone, successfully eliminating all toxic content (STA = 1). The core meaning—the firing of a police officer and the speaker's surprise implied by the question—is preserved through the interrogative form, so no essential information is lost (CS = 1). The neutral text is grammatically correct, concise, and easily understandable, with no fluency issues (FS = 1). All criteria are fully satisfied, resulting in a joint score of 1."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,How do you manage that?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the profanity 'fuck', which contributes to a harsh tone. The neutral text successfully removes this toxic element by omitting the expletive, resulting in a completely neutral and polite question. Therefore, Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1. The core meaning—expressing curiosity about how someone manages something—is fully preserved in the neutral version, so Content Similarity is 1. The rewritten sentence 'How do you manage that?' is grammatically correct, natural, and fluent, warranting a Fluency score of 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,How do you think people afford houses and cars?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the expletive 'fuck', which contributes a strong emotional and offensive tone. The neutral text removes this expletive entirely, replacing it with a clean, neutral version of the same question, thus achieving complete style transfer to a non-toxic form (STA = 1). The core meaning—questioning how people afford houses and cars—remains fully intact, with no addition or omission of key information, so content similarity is preserved perfectly (CS = 1). The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, showing no fluency issues (FS = 1). The joint score is therefore the average of three 1s, resulting in 1."
i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,I accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost freak out.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully replaces the toxic expression 'almost shit my pants' with the non-toxic and equivalent phrase 'almost freak out,' fully removing the offensive language while maintaining a neutral tone, thus achieving a Style Transfer Accuracy score of 1. The core meaning—that the speaker had a strong, startled reaction due to a misreading—is preserved without any significant information loss, warranting a Content Similarity score of 1. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and clearly expressed, so the Fluency score is also 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,I did not vandalize anything you did not do.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic term 'you dick' has been successfully removed and replaced with a neutral phrase 'you did not do,' resulting in completely neutral language with no offensive content. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the first part 'I did not vandalize anything' is preserved, the addition of 'you did not do' changes the original meaning significantly—it introduces a new, potentially confusing claim about the other person's actions, which was not in the original. This distorts the intended emphasis and reference, leading to partial but not complete preservation of meaning. Fluency (FS) is 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, syntactically sound, and fully readable, despite the semantic issue. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1)/3 = 0.83."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,i don't care about sides!.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the profane expression 'don't give a flying fuck', which is strongly vulgar and emotionally charged. The neutral text replaces this with 'don't care', which effectively removes the profanity and results in completely neutral language, satisfying the criteria for a score of 1 on Style Transfer Accuracy. The core meaning—that the speaker is indifferent toward 'sides'—is fully preserved; no key information is lost or altered, warranting a Content Similarity score of 1. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no fluency issues, justifying a Fluency score of 1. All three dimensions are optimally satisfied, resulting in a joint score of 1.0."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,I have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is nearly identical to the toxic text, with only the period at the end removed. The phrase 'wipe my ass' is vulgar and considered toxic due to its crude and offensive nature, and it remains unmodified in the output. Therefore, the Style Transfer Accuracy is 0 because no actual detoxification has occurred. Content Similarity is 1 because the meaning is fully preserved—there is no change in the core message or information. Fluency is 1 as the sentence is grammatically correct and easily understandable, despite the informality. The joint score is the average of the three: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but fucking seriously .,i mean it's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'fucking seriously', resulting in completely neutral language. The remaining content is respectful and free of any offensive or inappropriate language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core sentiment about the pope being cool and awesome is preserved, the original text includes a dismissive or critical tone at the end ('fucking seriously'), which suggests sarcasm or frustration that is completely omitted in the neutral version. This results in a partial loss of the original meaning and intent. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, well-structured, and fully readable without any language errors."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","i sell quite a bit of stuff on there, and paypal has ",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the toxic term 'shit' has been successfully replaced with the neutral term 'stuff', which effectively removes the offensive language and renders the sentence stylistically neutral. Therefore, STA is scored 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS), while the first part of the sentence retains the core meaning, the neutral text is cut off mid-sentence ('and paypal has'), resulting in the loss of the original claim that PayPal helped pay the bills. This significant but not total loss of meaning leads to a CS score of 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct up to the point of truncation, but because it is incomplete and ends abruptly, it disrupts readability and coherence. This makes the text partially understandable but flawed, warranting a score of 0.5."
"if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the shit out of him .","If hes found to have acted in cold blood, the feds are going",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'persecute the shit out of him', which is highly vulgar and aggressive, and replaces it with a truncated but non-toxic continuation. However, Content Similarity (CS) is 0.0 because the neutral text is incomplete—it cuts off mid-sentence ('the feds are going')—and thus fails to preserve the core meaning or intended consequence described in the original. The original meaning about severe federal punishment is lost due to incompleteness. Fluency (FS) is also 0.0 because the neutral text is grammatically incomplete and cannot be understood as a coherent sentence, making it difficult to read and interpret. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0 + 0) / 3 = 0.33."
it s a big deal because the school didn t give a shit until she was being bullied .,it s a big deal because the school didn't care until she,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'didn't give a shit' and replaces it with the more neutral 'didn't care', resulting in a completely non-toxic tone. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core idea — that the school only started paying attention after bullying occurred — is partially preserved, the neutral text is cut off mid-sentence ('until she'), leading to loss of critical information about the bullying context. Fluency (FS) is also 0.5 because the neutral text is grammatically correct up to the point of truncation but is incomplete and thus awkward to read; the sentence fails to form a complete thought, which impacts readability and coherence."
"judging by the shit i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .","judging by the things i ve seen in my number years, number of those",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic word 'shit' has been successfully replaced with the neutral term 'things', and the resulting text contains no offensive or toxic language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the beginning of the sentence retains the original intent of reflecting on experiences over the years, the second half 'number of those spent with george w .' is cut off in the neutral text, leading to a partial loss of core information. Fluency (FS) is also scored 0.5 because although the sentence structure is mostly understandable, the neutral text is incomplete and ends abruptly, making it feel unnatural and grammatically flawed due to the missing conclusion. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.6667."
"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up",it takes meminutes to resolve a page so you can fuck wikipedia up,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 0.5 because while the neutral text removes the explicit insult 'you fucking tosser' at the beginning, it retains the phrase 'you can fuck wikipedia up', which still contains profanity and aggressive intent. Thus, toxic content is partially removed but not fully neutralized. Content Similarity is scored 1 because the core meaning—that it takes minimal time to resolve a page and that certain users are capable of damaging Wikipedia—is preserved without significant alteration or information loss. Fluency is scored 1 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, syntactically sound, and fully readable despite the remaining profanity. The joint score is the average of the three: (0.5 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .",pants on fire justin,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text successfully removes the toxic term 'liar, liar' and retains only the idiomatic expression 'pants on fire justin', which on its own is not overtly toxic and can be interpreted as a playful or figurative critique. Thus, the language is now neutral, earning a score of 1. For Content Similarity (CS), while the core idea of accusing Justin of lying is partially preserved through the 'pants on fire' idiom, the repetition and emphasis in 'liar, liar' are lost, weakening the original intensity and rhetorical impact. This constitutes a partial loss of meaning, warranting a 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct, concise, and readable, despite being a fragment. It follows common expressive patterns in informal English, so it receives a 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,My thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag ,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is almost identical to the toxic text, with only the period at the end removed. The phrase 'dirt bag' is a derogatory expression and constitutes toxic content; however, it remains unchanged in the output. Therefore, the Style Transfer Accuracy is 0 because no toxic content has been removed. On the other hand, the Content Similarity is 1 because the core meaning is fully preserved—there is no alteration of intent or information. Fluency is also 1, as the sentence is grammatically correct and fully readable, despite the missing period being a minor punctuation issue that does not affect overall fluency. The joint score is the average of the three: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","No way number bricks fits in a car, this is bs ",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1 because the toxic expression 'fucking' has been successfully removed, and the resulting text uses neutral language without any offensive or profane content. The word 'bs' is retained but is considered a mild informal expression rather than overtly toxic in many contexts, and its presence does not undermine the overall neutrality. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 1 because the core meaning — disbelief that number bricks fit in a car and calling it unreasonable — is fully preserved; only the profanity was removed without altering the intent or key information. Fluency (FS) is scored 1 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and fully readable. The removal of 'fucking' does not disrupt sentence flow or clarity. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
noones asking you to invade shit .,no one is asking you to invade things.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic language: the original toxic text uses the word 'shit', which is a profane expression, and it is replaced with the neutral term 'things', making the language completely non-toxic. Thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1. The core meaning is preserved: the intent of the sentence — that no one is demanding or expecting an invasion — remains intact, and the substitution of 'shit' with 'things' does not alter the essential message, so Content Similarity is 1. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding: 'no one is asking you to invade things' is a fluent and properly structured sentence with no errors, warranting a Fluency score of 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,not playing around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the phrase 'not fucking around', which is a profane expression used for emphasis. In the neutral text, 'fucking' is replaced with 'playing', resulting in 'not playing around'. This substitution successfully removes the profanity while maintaining a similar tone and intent. The resulting sentence is completely neutral in style, with no residual toxic language, warranting a Style Transfer Accuracy score of 1. The core meaning—that the speaker is serious and not engaging carelessly with foreign matters they cannot influence—is fully preserved, so Content Similarity is scored 1. The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and free of any fluency issues, justifying a Fluency score of 1. The joint score is therefore the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."

However, Content Similarity (CS) is 0.0 because the neutral text is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence, failing to preserve the core meaning or complete the thought of the original text. Fluency (FS) is also 0.0 because the neutral text ends abruptly and is grammatically incomplete, making it difficult to understand.

The neutral text successfully removes this profanity by omitting the word entirely, resulting in a completely neutral expression. Therefore, Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 as the toxic content is fully removed and the language is now neutral. The core meaning of the sentence—that having a number will solve many problems if necessary—is preserved without any significant change or information loss, so Content Similarity is also 1.0. The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with only a minor spelling error ('alot' instead of 'a lot'); however, this does not impede readability or fluency, so Fluency is scored 1.0. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."

In the neutral text, 'shit' is replaced with 'stuff', which is a neutral and appropriate synonym, effectively removing the toxic content while maintaining a completely neutral tone—thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1. The core meaning of the sentence—that Wikipedia has articles on many random topics—is fully preserved, with only a non-essential lexical change; hence, Content Similarity is 1.

"quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some idiot hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .",quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some hierarch,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'idiot hierarch' and replaces it with the neutral term 'hierarch', eliminating the derogatory language and resulting in a completely non-toxic statement. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core idea—that saints are canonized for opposing a religious authority—is preserved, the neutral version omits the key detail that the opposition led to martyrdom ('even unto being killed'), which is a significant part of the original meaning.

The core meaning—urging someone to consult a link they provided—remains intact without any loss of information, so content similarity is fully preserved (CS = 1).

same crap going on in the pnw too .,same crap going on in the pnw too.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text: 'same crap going on in the pnw too.' The word 'crap' carries a negative and mildly offensive connotation, which qualifies as toxic content in this context. Since no rewriting has been done, the toxic content remains entirely unaltered, resulting in an STA score of 0. However, because the text is unchanged, the core meaning is fully preserved, earning a CS score of 1. The sentence is grammatically correct and easily understandable, so the FS score is 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
"shit , i d love an number pm sunset .",i d love an number pm sunset.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic word 'shit' is successfully removed from the neutral text, resulting in completely neutral language with no remaining toxic expressions, warranting a Style Transfer Accuracy score of 1.0.

The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and readable, despite the slightly unusual phrasing ('an number'), which is present in both the toxic and neutral versions and does not impede understanding; thus, Fluency is scored 1.0. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped in the ass .,some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the highly toxic and vulgar expression 'to get raped in the ass', resulting in a completely neutral tone. The revised sentence no longer contains any offensive or harmful language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core event — a poor person robbing a liquor store and going to prison — is preserved, the original sentence's implication about the harsh and violent consequences of prison (i.e., sexual violence) is removed, which was a significant part of the original meaning. This constitutes a notable loss of intent and context, though the main factual claim remains. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any linguistic errors. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
"someone says no , and they say fuck off we need vets only for free housing ? .","someone says no, and they say fuck off we need vets only for",0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA): The neutral text retains the phrase 'fuck off', which is a clear toxic expression, so the detoxification is incomplete. However, the potentially problematic implication about 'vets only for free housing' is partially mitigated by truncation, though not rephrased. Thus, STA is 0.5 due to partial removal of toxicity. For Content Similarity (CS): The neutral text cuts off mid-sentence ('we need vets only for'), resulting in loss of the original's full intent regarding free housing for veterans. Core elements like refusal and strong reaction are present, but key information is lost, warranting a 0.5. For Fluency (FS): The neutral text ends abruptly and lacks completion, making it syntactically incomplete. While the beginning is grammatically correct, the sudden ending disrupts readability. It is understandable in part but flawed, justifying a 0.5. The joint score is the average: (0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5)/3 = 0.5."
still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,still standing up for your leader who loves himself and nobody else.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text successfully removes the toxic adjectives 'lying' and 'crazy', which were subjective and derogatory, resulting in a completely neutral description of the leader. Thus, STA is scored 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS), while the core idea of someone 'still standing up for your leader who loves himself and nobody else' is preserved, the removal of 'lying' and 'crazy' alters the original characterization of the leader, which was a key part of the speaker's sentiment and judgment. This constitutes a partial loss of meaning, so CS is scored 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any linguistic issues, so FS is scored 1.0. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1)/3 = 0.83."

The phrase retains its vulgar and exaggerated negative connotation without any mitigation or rephrasing, thus failing to remove toxic content. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is a verbatim copy of the original, so all original meaning and emphasis are fully preserved. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the sentence is grammatically correct, syntactically sound, and easily understandable despite its informal and colloquial tone.

Content Similarity (CS) is scored 1.0 because the core meaning—that the event in question rarely occurs except in certain negatively characterized countries—is preserved without significant information loss. Fluency (FS) is scored 0.5 because the neutral text contains a grammatical error: 'excepts rarely' should be 'except rarely' (the verb form 'excepts' is incorrect in this context). This error affects the language quality and readability, though the sentence remains largely understandable. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."

Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core idea — that cheap items have poor quality and a more expensive alternative might be better — is partially preserved, the neutral text is cut off mid-sentence ('getting the'), resulting in a significant loss of information and incompleteness. Fluency (FS) is also scored 0.5 because although the beginning of the sentence is grammatically correct and understandable, the abrupt ending makes the text feel incomplete and disrupts readability. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.6667."
they need stop tratening people like morons .,they need stop tratening people like these people.,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA): The original toxic text contains the derogatory term 'morons', which is a toxic expression. The neutral text replaces it with 'these people', which removes the explicit insult but does so vaguely. However, the verb 'tratenen' (likely intended to be 'treating') is still associated with negative condescension, and the overall tone remains somewhat dismissive. Thus, toxic content is partially removed, warranting a 0.5. For Content Similarity (CS): The core message — that people are being treated poorly or disrespectfully — is somewhat preserved, but the replacement of 'morons' with 'these people' introduces ambiguity and loses the original's specific (though offensive) characterization. This results in partial meaning preservation, justifying a 0.5. For Fluency (FS): Both the toxic and neutral texts contain the misspelling 'tratenen' instead of 'treating', and the neutral version has awkward phrasing ('like these people') that disrupts natural flow. While the sentence is still understandable, these errors reduce readability, leading to a 0.5. The joint score is the average of the three: (0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.5."

Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the general sentiment of criticism is preserved, the intensity and specificity of the original phrase 'fucked up' (which implies serious psychological or behavioral dysfunction) is significantly weakened by the vague term 'bad', leading to a partial loss of meaning. Fluency is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence 'they re both bad' is grammatically correct and readable, despite the missing apostrophe in 're' (they're), which is considered a minor typo and does not impair understanding."

The resulting text does not contain any offensive or toxic expressions. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core idea—that the person lacks business acumen and forward-thinking ability—is partially preserved, the original text's stronger judgment and specific accusation of being a 'sellout' are lost. Additionally, the neutral text appears to be cut off ('lacks the ability of forward'), which results in incomplete meaning transfer. Fluency (FS) is scored 0.5 because the neutral text is mostly understandable but ends abruptly, suggesting incompleteness, and the phrase 'ability of forward' is grammatically incorrect or incomplete (should be 'ability for forward thinking' or similar), indicating expression issues."
"this is a joke , are you all fucking retards ? .","this is a joke, are you all retards?.",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text removes the profanity 'fucking' but retains the word 'retards', which is a derogatory term and still constitutes toxic content. Therefore, the detoxification is only partial, warranting a score of 0.5. For Content Similarity (CS), the meaning of the original sentence is fully preserved—the speaker is making a sarcastic or mocking remark implying others are unintelligent. No core information is lost, so the score is 1. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct, syntactically sound, and fully readable, so it receives a score of 1.

The core meaning of the sentence—expressing that something is reminiscent of 'The Twilight Zone' in a figurative way—is preserved exactly; only the vulgar term is replaced without altering intent or context—so Content Similarity is 1.0.

The language is now neutral and does not contain any profanity or aggressive expressions. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general negative sentiment is preserved, the original text expresses strong personal contempt with an insult, whereas the neutral version is milder and more general. The core idea of disapproval is retained, but the intensity and specific characterization are diminished, leading to partial meaning preservation.

"yeah , comparitively fuck all because they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and smart accountants ? .","yeah, comparitively fuck all because they have loads of offshore",0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 0.5 because the neutral text partially removes toxic content but retains the profanity 'fuck all', which is a vulgar expression and contributes to the overall toxicity. While the sentence structure suggests a critical tone toward financial inequality, the explicit language has not been fully detoxified. Content Similarity (CS) is 0.5 because the neutral text preserves the general idea of someone having little in comparison due to others' offshore accounts, but the truncation ('...and smart accountants?') results in incomplete information and loss of the full original context. Fluency (FS) is 0.5 because the neutral text is mostly understandable but ends abruptly, creating a fragment that lacks syntactic completeness and disrupts readability. The grammar in the existing portion is acceptable, but the incomplete sentence reduces overall fluency."

Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the neutral text retains the mention of 'ban me', which appears to be a core element of the original context, it omits the confrontational and expressive intent toward others, leading to partial loss of meaning—specifically the sentiment and target of frustration. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text 'yeh well ban me ban me' is grammatically correct, syntactically valid, and easily understandable, despite being repetitive.

The phrase 'I must kill it' is a violent expression and remains unchanged in the output, indicating no detoxification has occurred. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 1 because the neutral text preserves the original meaning entirely—there is no alteration or loss of core information.

Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the intent to stop interference with edits is preserved, the removal of 'fucking' and the resulting phrase 'stop up my edits' alters the emphasis and intensity of the original message. The core request is maintained, but the strength of the complaint is diminished, leading to partial meaning preservation. Fluency is scored 1.0 because despite the awkwardness of 'stop up my edits', the sentence is grammatically correct, readable, and free of syntactic errors. The phrase may be less idiomatic, but it does not impair overall comprehension. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1)/3 = 0.83."
You amins are such bastards.,You amins are such mean people.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic term 'bastards' has been successfully replaced with the neutral expression 'mean people', effectively removing the offensive language while maintaining a completely neutral tone, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning of the original sentence—that the group 'amins' is being criticized for unkind behavior—is preserved, as 'mean people' conveys a similar negative characterization without vulgarity, so content similarity is fully maintained (CS = 1). The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no fluency issues, warranting a fluency score of 1. All three dimensions are optimal, resulting in a joint score of 1.0."

Randi was born a DICK.,Randi was born a mean person.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the offensive term 'DICK' and replaces it with a non-toxic expression 'mean person', resulting in a completely neutral tone. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general negative characterization of Randi is preserved, the original insult (which may carry connotations of both gender and behavior) is simplified to 'mean person', losing some of the original's intensity and possible contextual nuance. However, the core idea that Randi was born with negative traits is partially retained. Fluency (FS) is 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1)/3 = 0.83."
This is your last warning; stop being an asshole.,This is your last warning; stop being mean.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully replaces the toxic term 'asshole' with the non-toxic and more neutral term 'mean', effectively removing the offensive language while maintaining a similar level of admonishment. This achieves full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1).

"MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize, so fuck you.","I do not vandalize, so please stop.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes all toxic content (e.g., 'fuck you' and aggressive capitalization) and expresses the sentiment in a completely neutral and polite manner. Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the core idea of 'I do not vandalize' is preserved, the original emphasis on asserting user page autonomy ('MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT') is completely omitted, leading to partial loss of meaning. Fluency is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding: 'I do not vandalize, so please stop.' There are no linguistic errors or readability issues."
I am Nancy and I like to fuck up people's fun.,I am Nancy and I like to mess up people's fun.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA): The original toxic text uses the phrase 'fuck up people's fun', which is a vulgar and aggressive expression. In the neutral text, it is replaced with 'mess up people's fun', which conveys a similar action but in a non-toxic, socially acceptable way. The language is now completely neutral, so STA is scored 1. For Content Similarity (CS): The core meaning—that Nancy enjoys disrupting others' enjoyment—is preserved exactly. 'Mess up' is a mild synonym of 'fuck up' in this context, so there is no meaningful loss of information, warranting a CS score of 1. For Fluency (FS): The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding. There are no syntactic or lexical issues, so FS is scored 1.

"Heh, look, not EVERYTHING is on google. you are a dumbass.","Heh, look, not EVERYTHING is on google. you are a ",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text successfully removes the toxic term 'dumbass', resulting in a completely neutral tone, so a score of 1.0 is assigned. For Content Similarity (CS), the original insult is removed, but the neutral text is cut off abruptly after 'you are a ', which leads to incomplete expression and partial loss of intended meaning; thus, only partial meaning is preserved, warranting a score of 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text ends mid-sentence due to the truncation, creating a serious structural issue that disrupts readability, though the beginning is grammatically correct; therefore, it is understandable up to the point of cutoff but flawed, justifying a score of 0.5."
Thanks for being an ass when I tried to help.,Thanks for not helping when I tried to help.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'being an ass' and replaces it with a non-toxic alternative, resulting in completely neutral language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general context of unhelpful behavior is preserved, the original meaning—expressing frustration at someone being deliberately obstructive or rude—is altered. The neutral version implies lack of help, but loses the emotional nuance and intent of rudeness, leading to partial information loss. Fluency (FS) is 1 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and readable without any language issues."
"You're a fucking moron, go read the notability guidelines.","You're not smart, go read the notability guidelines.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1 because the toxic expression 'fucking moron' has been successfully replaced with the neutral phrase 'not smart', eliminating profanity and hostile language while maintaining a critical tone. The resulting text is completely free of toxic content and uses acceptable language.

These people are INSANE.,These people are crazy.,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the toxic term 'INSANE' is replaced with 'crazy', which is less intense but still carries a negative and potentially derogatory connotation. While the capitalization (which may indicate strong emotion) is removed, 'crazy' is not fully neutral and can still be considered a mild insult, so the detoxification is only partial—hence a score of 0.5. For Content Similarity (CS), the core meaning—that the speaker views these people as irrational or extreme—is preserved without significant alteration, so the score is 1.

Did you know that you are an ugly piece of shit?,Did you know that you are an ugly person?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text successfully removes the highly offensive phrase 'piece of shit' and replaces it with the more neutral term 'person', resulting in a completely non-toxic expression. Therefore, STA is scored 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS), while the core idea of calling someone 'ugly' is preserved, the original text uses a strongly dehumanizing insult ('piece of shit') that carries much stronger contempt and hostility than 'ugly person'. This softening significantly alters the intensity and emotional meaning of the original, leading to partial meaning preservation only, hence CS is scored 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no issues in readability or expression, so FS is scored 1.0. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."

The neutral text is identical to the toxic text, meaning the toxic content has not been removed at all; hence, the Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 0. The Content Similarity (CS) is 1 because the output preserves the original meaning exactly with no alterations or information loss. Fluency (FS) is 1 as the sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding.

Fluency is perfect as the sentence is grammatically correct and easily understandable, warranting an FS score of 1. However, the failure to remove any toxic language means the style transfer has completely failed."
"Stop defending pedophiles, faggot.",Stop defending pedophiles.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic term 'faggot', which is a homophobic slur, resulting in completely neutral language. Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the core action (urging someone to stop defending pedophiles) is preserved, the original text includes a direct personal attack ('faggot') that adds a layer of intent and emotional context (condemnation of the addressee's character) which is lost in the neutral version. Thus, some meaning is lost even though the primary message remains. Fluency is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and fully readable.

Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the first part of the sentence ('I'm afraid I can't verify it as his myspace account has been') preserves a portion of the original meaning, the deletion of the final clause results in a loss of the speaker's emotional reaction, which was a core component of the original message. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct and readable, despite being an incomplete sentence; it does not contain any grammatical errors and conveys a clear, understandable idea."
