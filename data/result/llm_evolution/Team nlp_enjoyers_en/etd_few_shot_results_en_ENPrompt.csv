any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,any of us who did half this would be locked up already.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA=1: All profanity (“shit”, “the fuck”) is removed and the tone is neutral. CS=1: The core claim—if any of us did even half of these actions, we’d already be incarcerated—remains intact. FS=0.5: The neutral sentence is understandable but slightly ungrammatical/elliptical (“half this” lacks “of” or a noun, e.g., “half of this” or “half of these actions”), which reduces fluency."
are they liars or just clueless ?,Are they liars or just clueless?,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text only adjusts capitalization and spacing; it retains the toxic terms 'liars' and 'clueless', so no detoxification occurred (STA=0). The meaning is fully preserved (CS=1). The neutral text is grammatically correct and well-punctuated (FS=1)."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .",i still say this guy is not a good person.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA=1: The profanity and direct insult ('piece of shit') are removed and replaced with a neutral, non-abusive judgment ('not a good person'), with no toxic or slur-like language remaining. CS=0.5: The overall negative stance toward the target is preserved, but key context ('as someone from LA and an oilfield worker') is dropped and the strength of the insult is softened, resulting in partial meaning preservation. FS=1: The neutral sentence is clear and grammatical/readable, despite informal lowercase 'i'; it reads fluently."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","calm down, cnn.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text removes the profanity ('fuck'), making the sentence fully neutral while keeping the directive to CNN intact, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1. The core meaning—telling CNN to calm down—remains unchanged despite the loss of intensity, so Content Similarity is 1. The neutral sentence is fluent with proper punctuation and spacing; lowercase 'cnn' is a stylistic choice and not a grammatical error, so Fluency is 1."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,China and Russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The neutral text keeps the violent phrasing ('big stick', 'smack trump around') and thus does not detoxify the sentence. It is truncated after 'if those', omitting the core conditional clause ('ships do anything foolish'), so the original meaning is not preserved. It is also a sentence fragment with improper capitalization of 'trump', making it ungrammatical and not fluent."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,They rarely care about facts,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The insult 'cretins' was removed and replaced with a neutral pronoun ('They'), eliminating toxic language. CS: The core claim ('rarely care about facts') is preserved, but the referential nuance ('like this') and explicit subject are lost, making the target less specific—hence partial preservation. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and reads naturally."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,do people actually believe this???,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text removes the profanity ('shit') entirely, resulting in a fully neutral tone (STA=1.0). The core meaning—questioning whether people believe something—remains unchanged, with only the emphatic expletive dropped (CS=1.0). The sentence is fluent and readable; punctuation is acceptable and there are no grammatical issues (FS=1.0)."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","dont you ever change one of my edits, or i will come to your",0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"STA=0.5: The explicit violent phrase ('and i will cut you') is removed, but the sentence still contains a threat/ultimatum ('dont you ever… or i will come to your…'), so the tone remains intimidating rather than neutral. CS=0.5: The first clause is preserved, but the second clause is truncated, losing key information ('house' and the violent act), thus only partially retaining the original meaning. FS=0.5: The neutral text is a fragment ending with 'your', has casing/punctuation issues ('dont', lowercase 'i'), yet remains generally understandable."
even bush knows he fucked up .,even bush knows he is bad,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: Profanity ('fucked up') is removed, but the rewrite ('he is bad') remains a pejorative, non-neutral judgment—partial detox only. CS: The original claims Bush knows he made a specific mistake; the rewrite asserts he is generally bad, changing the core proposition and losing the event-specific meaning. FS: The sentence is understandable but lacks proper capitalization and terminal punctuation ('even bush...' and no period), so fluency is imperfect."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,popeyes for doing this in the first place,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The neutral text removes the explicit profanity ('fuck') and contains no remaining toxic or aggressive wording. CS: The original conveys condemnation toward Popeyes for having done something, while the neutral output reduces to a bare fragment that mentions Popeyes and 'doing this in the first place' but drops the negative stance, resulting in partial meaning preservation. FS: The neutral text is an incomplete sentence lacking subject/verb, capitalization, and terminal punctuation; it's understandable but not fully fluent."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,"STA=0.0 because the neutral text still contains the profanity ('ass') and does not neutralize tone. CS=0.5 because while the setup ('getting my ... by GRE practice tests made sure that I never make this same') mirrors the source, it drops the key conclusion ('mistake again'), losing core meaning. FS=0.0 because the sentence is truncated and ungrammatical, lacking an object and proper ending punctuation, making it difficult to read."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,getting stronger every month yeah i wish.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text removes the single profane intensifier ('fucking'), making the tone fully neutral (STA=1.0). The core meaning—expressing skepticism or sarcasm about getting stronger every month—remains unchanged; only emphasis is reduced (CS=1.0). The neutral sentence is fluent and easily readable; while informal and lowercase, it has no grammatical errors that impede comprehension (FS=1.0)."
have you ever been to r trees and seen all the shit people say weed can do ? .,have you ever been to r trees and seen all the things people say weed can,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"The neutral text successfully removes the profanity ('shit') by using 'things', making the tone non-toxic (STA=1.0). However, it truncates the original question by dropping 'do ?,' which omits the action and weakens the core meaning—only partial preservation (CS=0.5). The truncation also yields an incomplete sentence and missing punctuation; it's still understandable but grammatically flawed (FS=0.5)."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .",a cop got fired?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text removes the vulgar exclamation 'holy shit,' yielding fully neutral language (STA=1.0). It preserves the core proposition and interrogative intent—questioning whether a cop was fired—so no core meaning is lost (CS=1.0). The result is fluent and natural; punctuation is correct and readability is improved compared to the original's extraneous punctuation (FS=1.0)."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,How do you manage that?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Profanity ('the fuck') is fully removed, yielding a neutral question (STA=1.0). The core meaning—asking how someone manages something—remains intact; only emphasis/intensity is dropped, which doesn't alter the core proposition (CS=1.0). The neutral text is well-formed with proper capitalization and punctuation, and reads naturally (FS=1.0)."
how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,How do you think people afford houses and cars?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text removes the profanity ('fuck') and is fully non-toxic (STA=1.0). The core meaning—a question about how people afford houses and cars—remains unchanged (CS=1.0). The rewrite is grammatically clean with proper capitalization and punctuation, improving readability (FS=1.0)."
i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,I accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost freak out.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"The neutral text removes the vulgar phrase ('shit my pants') and replaces it with a non-toxic expression ('freak out'), so style transfer accuracy is complete. The core meaning—misreading a phrase as 'laser machete' and reacting with strong fear/surprise—is preserved, warranting full content similarity. However, the neutral sentence has a tense mismatch ('almost freak out' should be 'almost freaked out'), which reduces fluency despite being understandable."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,I did not vandalize anything you did not do.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA=1: The toxic insult 'you dick' is fully removed and the wording is neutral. CS=0.5: While the denial 'I did not vandalize anything' is retained, adding 'you did not do' changes the proposition into an odd comparative/relative clause that alters the original straightforward meaning and introduces ambiguity. FS=0.5: The neutral sentence is understandable but awkward and semantically confusing ('anything you did not do'), which hurts readability."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,i don't care about sides!.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'i dont give a flying fuck' has been completely neutralized by 'i don't care', which removes the vulgarity and maintains the original meaning. The language is fluent, with no grammatical errors, and the core message remains intact."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,I have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text retains the vulgar phrase 'wipe my ass', so toxic content is not removed (STA=0). The meaning is identical to the original aside from capitalization and punctuation (CS=1). The sentence reads naturally and is grammatically sound; capitalization is corrected and the lack of a final period does not hinder readability (FS=1)."
i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but fucking seriously .,i mean it's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA=1.0: The profanity ('fucking') is fully removed and the tone is neutral. CS=0.5: The neutral text truncates the latter clause ('and stuff but ... seriously'), losing the contrast/emphasis and part of the original structure, so only the praise about the pope remains. FS=0.5: The output reads as an incomplete sentence (abrupt ending, no terminal punctuation) and is stylistically clunky with repeated 'awesome', though understandable."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","i sell quite a bit of stuff on there, and paypal has ",1.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,"STA: The toxic word 'shit' is replaced with the neutral term 'stuff', and no aggressive/insulting language remains. CS: The first clause ('i sell quite a bit of stuff on there') preserves the original meaning, but the second clause is truncated and omits the key information that PayPal helped pay the bills, leading to partial preservation. FS: The neutral text ends with the fragment 'and paypal has', making the sentence ungrammatical and incomplete, which harms readability."
"if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the shit out of him .","If hes found to have acted in cold blood, the feds are going",1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The profanity 'the shit out of him' is removed and the remaining wording is neutral. CS: The output truncates after 'the feds are going', omitting the main action and target, so the core meaning is not preserved. FS: The sentence is a fragment and has a grammatical error ('hes' → 'he's'); it's still somewhat understandable but not fully fluent."
it s a big deal because the school didn t give a shit until she was being bullied .,it s a big deal because the school didn't care until she,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy: The toxic phrase “didn’t give a shit” is successfully neutralized to “didn’t care,” removing vulgarity (STA=1.0). Content Similarity: The neutral text is truncated after “she,” omitting the crucial clause “was being bullied,” which conveys the trigger/timeline; thus the core meaning is not preserved (CS=0.0). Fluency: The neutral output is an incomplete sentence, lacks the required predicate after “she,” and also contains minor orthographic issues (e.g., “it s” vs. “it’s”), making it ungrammatical and hard to read (FS=0.0)."
"judging by the shit i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .","judging by the things i ve seen in my number years, number of those",1.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,"STA: The profanity 'shit' is replaced by the neutral term 'things', fully removing toxic language. CS: The second clause 'spent with george w.' is dropped, so while the first clause's intent is kept, key information about time spent with a person is lost. FS: The neutral sentence is truncated ('number of those') and remains a fragment with capitalization issues, making it grammatically incorrect and hard to read."
"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up",it takes meminutes to resolve a page so you can fuck wikipedia up,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"STA: The neutral text removes explicit insults and slurs (e.g., direct name-calling) but still contains profanity directed at the addressee ('fuck ... up'), so toxicity is only partially removed. CS: The core claim ('it takes me minutes to resolve a page') and the accusation that the addressee messes up Wikipedia are preserved, but the threat component ('last warning') and the generalized target ('...like you') are lost, reducing semantic completeness. FS: The sentence is understandable but has a typo ('meminutes'), improper capitalization ('wikipedia'), and awkward causality ('so you can ...'), which harms fluency."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .",pants on fire justin,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"The neutral text removes the explicit insult 'liar, liar' but keeps the taunting idiom 'pants on fire' directed at Justin, which still implies dishonesty, so toxicity is only partially reduced (STA=0.5). The core meaning—accusing Justin of lying—is hinted at but less explicit and loses clarity/context (CS=0.5). The neutral text is a fragment lacking proper capitalization, punctuation, and a clear syntactic structure, yet remains understandable (FS=0.5)."
my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,My thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag ,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text does not change any toxic content and remains the same as the toxic text, so the toxic language ('dirt bag') is still present. The content is exactly the same, meaning the core information is preserved. The language is fluent and grammatically correct, but the toxic expression was not removed, so Style Transfer Accuracy score is 0.0."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","No way number bricks fits in a car, this is bs ",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text partially removes the toxic content by removing the vulgar expression 'no fucking way', but it still retains 'bs' which is informal and could be considered mildly derogatory. The core meaning of the original text is preserved, but the tone remains somewhat informal. The language is fluent and grammatically correct, with no major errors."
noones asking you to invade shit .,no one is asking you to invade things.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Profanity ('shit') is replaced with the neutral 'things', eliminating toxic language (STA=1.0). The core meaning—no one is asking the addressee to invade anything—is fully preserved (CS=1.0). The rewrite is grammatically correct and reads naturally ('no one is asking you to...') with proper spacing and punctuation (FS=1.0)."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,not playing around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA=1: The neutral text replaces the explicit profanity ('fucking') with a non-toxic term ('playing'), yielding neutral tone. CS=0.5: The main proposition—avoiding involvement in foreign matters we cannot affect—remains, but 'playing around' can imply being frivolous rather than 'meddling/intervening,' introducing slight semantic drift. FS=0.5: The sentence is understandable but a bit awkward ('playing around in foreign matters' is not very idiomatic) and lacks standard capitalization at the start; overall readable but not fully natural."
nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady as fuck .,nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The neutral text removes the vulgar phrase ('shady as fuck') and contains no toxic expressions, so STA=1. However, it truncates the sentence and omits key content ('that unaccounted for time' and the notion that events would look suspicious), failing to preserve the core meaning—CS=0. The result is an incomplete fragment ending with 'during', which is ungrammatical and not fluent—FS=0."
number will solve alot of fucking problems if it comes down to it .,number will solve alot of problems if it comes down to it.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"The neutral text removes the profanity ('fucking'), resulting in a neutral tone (STA=1). The core meaning—'number will solve a lot of problems if necessary'—is preserved without content loss (CS=1). Fluency is acceptable but not perfect due to the misspelling 'alot' and the awkward/missing article before 'number' (e.g., 'the number'/'a number'), so readability is slightly affected (FS=0.5)."
org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random shit like this .,org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random stuff like this.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"Profanity ('shit') was replaced with neutral wording ('stuff'), fully removing toxic tone (STA=1.0). The statement’s meaning is preserved—asserting Wikipedia has articles on random topics (CS=1.0). Fluency is only fair due to minor issues: 'there s' should be 'there's', the leading 'org' is fragmentary, and capitalization/punctuation are inconsistent, so it's understandable but not polished (FS=0.5)."
"ouch man , them swedes were dicks to norway =\","ouch man, them swedes were bad to norway =\",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: Replaces the vulgar insult 'dicks' with the neutral adjective 'bad', removing profanity and abusive tone. CS: Preserves the core proposition and sentiment (Swedes behaved negatively toward Norway), retaining the interjection and emoticon. FS: Understandable but nonstandard; 'them swedes' is ungrammatical and proper nouns are uncapitalized, and 'bad to Norway' is slightly awkward, so fluency is only partial."
people are idiots for wasting emergency call time on crap like this .,people are not smart for wasting emergency call time on crap like this.,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA=0.5 because the explicit insult 'idiots' is softened to 'not smart' (less toxic), but the mild profanity 'crap' remains, so detox is only partial. CS=1.0 because the core meaning—criticizing people for wasting emergency call time—remains intact. FS=1.0 since the neutral sentence is grammatical and readable, though a slightly more natural phrasing could be 'not smart to waste...'; still fully fluent."
"quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some idiot hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .",quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some hierarch,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The insult 'idiot' is removed and the tone is neutral, so toxic content is fully eliminated. CS: The neutral version drops key information—'even unto being killed' and the example 'like st.'—narrowing the meaning from martyrdom due to opposition to merely opposing a hierarch, hence partial preservation. FS: The sentence is grammatical and readable; while 'some hierarch' is slightly awkward, it remains fluent with no errors."
read your own fucking link .,read your own link,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The expletive 'fucking' was removed, leaving a neutral imperative. CS: The directive 'read your own link' preserves the original intent without altering core meaning. FS: The neutral sentence is a clear, grammatical imperative; capitalization and terminal punctuation are optional here and do not impede fluency."
same crap going on in the pnw too .,same crap going on in the pnw too.,0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"The neutral text leaves the toxic term 'crap' unchanged, so toxicity is not removed (STA=0.0). Meaning is fully preserved because the texts are effectively identical aside from spacing (CS=1.0). Fluency is slightly improved by fixing the stray space before the period, but the sentence remains a fragment with informal/lowercase style ('pnw' and no initial capitalization), so it is understandable but not fully polished (FS=0.5)."
"shit , i d love an number pm sunset .",i d love an number pm sunset.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"The neutral text removes the expletive 'shit', yielding a fully neutral tone (STA=1.0). Removing that interjection does not change the core intent—expressing desire for a number around/at 'pm sunset'—so meaning is preserved (CS=1.0). However, the neutral sentence is still ungrammatical and awkward: split contraction ('i d'), incorrect article ('an number'), missing capitalization/punctuation, and the fragmentary phrase 'pm sunset' reduce readability (FS=0.5)."
some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped in the ass .,some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA=1: The neutral text removes the explicitly toxic/sexual-violence clause (“get raped in the ass”) and leaves a neutral tone. CS=0.5: While it preserves the robbery amount ($400) and the consequence of going to prison, it omits the assault outcome, which is a salient part of the original meaning, so only partial preservation. FS=1: The neutral sentence is clear and grammatical (minor missing terminal punctuation aside), making it fully fluent."
"someone says no , and they say fuck off we need vets only for free housing ? .","someone says no, and they say fuck off we need vets only for",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.25,"The neutral text successfully removes some toxic language (e.g., 'fuck off'), but the phrase 'we need vets only for' still seems incomplete, leaving some ambiguity. The core message about needing vets is preserved, but the meaning is somewhat diluted due to the truncation. The language is fluent and understandable with no major grammatical errors."
still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,still standing up for your leader who loves himself and nobody else.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text removes the explicitly toxic descriptors 'lying' and 'crazy,' yielding a neutral tone (STA=1). However, those descriptors also conveyed specific claims about the leader, so some semantic content is lost even though the core message—standing up for a leader who loves himself and nobody else—remains (CS=0.5). The neutral sentence is clear and grammatically acceptable, reading smoothly despite being an informal fragment (FS=1)."
sucked like nothings ever sucked before .,Sucked like nothings ever sucked before.,0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy: The neutral text retains the vulgar term 'sucked' with no reduction in toxicity, so STA=0. Content Similarity: Meaning is identical to the original, so CS=1. Fluency: Minor cleanup (capitalization and spacing) improves readability, but it remains ungrammatical ('nothings' should be 'nothing's' or 'nothing has') and reads as a sentence fragment, so FS=0.5."
taking a stand with either party is equally retarded .,taking a stand with either party is equally retarded.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy: 0 — the ableist slur remains unchanged; only spacing before the period was adjusted, so toxicity is not removed. Content Similarity: 1 — the meaning is exactly the same as the original. Fluency: 1 — punctuation is corrected and the sentence is grammatically clear; while the word choice is offensive, FS evaluates form/readability, not toxicity."
that almost never happens excepts rarely in shit hole countries .,That almost never happens excepts rarely in bad countries.,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"The neutral text replaces 'shit hole' with 'bad', which is a neutral term, but the term 'bad countries' still carries a somewhat negative connotation, meaning the toxic nature is not fully removed. The core meaning is preserved, but the language is not entirely neutral. Additionally, 'excepts' is an incorrect usage and impacts the fluency, making it slightly awkward. However, it’s still understandable."
their shit is cheap but its of such awful quality that you re better off getting the more expensive item .,their stuff is cheap but its of such bad quality that you re better off getting the,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,"STA: Profanity 'shit' is replaced with 'stuff' and 'awful' softened to 'bad', leaving a neutral tone (1.0). CS: The main idea (cheap but low quality; recommendation to choose an alternative) is implied, but the sentence truncates and omits the key target 'the more expensive item', causing loss of core information (0.5). FS: The neutral sentence is incomplete ('getting the'), and also has grammatical/spacing errors ('its' vs. 'it's', 'you re'), making it ungrammatical and hard to read (0.0)."
they need stop tratening people like morons .,they need stop tratening people like these people.,1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA=1: The explicit insult 'morons' is removed; no slurs or profanity remain, so tone is neutral. CS=0: The core meaning shifts from 'stop treating people as if they are morons (i.e., condescendingly)' to the unclear 'stop treating people like these people,' which loses the original criticism and alters intent. FS=0.5: The neutral text is somewhat understandable but has clear errors—missing 'to' ('they need to stop'), misspelling ('tratening' for 'treating'), and the awkward, ambiguous phrase 'like these people'—so it is not fully fluent."
they re both fucked up .,they re both bad,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the vulgar expression 'fucked up' and replaces it with the more neutral 'bad.' The core meaning of the original sentence is fully preserved, and the language is fluent and grammatically correct."
this guy is a total sellout with no brains for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking .,This guy is not a good person for business and lacks the ability of forward ,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA=1.0 because the neutral text removes direct insults like 'total sellout' and 'no brains' and uses non-abusive wording. CS=0.5 since the idea that the person is poor at business is preserved, but the 'sellout' (betrayal) aspect is lost and 'forward thinking' is truncated, reducing core content. FS=0.5 because the sentence is partly fluent but contains an incomplete/incorrect phrase ('lacks the ability of forward') and ends abruptly, which harms readability while remaining mostly understandable."
"this is a joke , are you all fucking retards ? .","this is a joke, are you all retards?.",0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA: The neutral text removes the profanity ('fucking') but retains the ableist slur ('retards'), so toxicity is only partially removed. CS: The core meaning and intent of the original—calling the statement a joke and insulting the audience—are fully preserved. FS: The sentence is understandable but has punctuation issues (ends with '?.') and informal casing; overall readable but not fully fluent."
this is some twilight zone shit,this is some twilight zone thing,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the colloquial and somewhat vulgar expression ('shit') and replaces it with the more neutral word 'thing.' The core meaning of the original sentence remains intact, and the language is fluent and natural without any grammatical issues."
this shit is overwhelming to think about .,This is overwhelming to think about,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic term 'shit' is removed, resulting in fully neutral language (STA=1). The neutral text preserves the original meaning—something is overwhelming to think about—without loss of core information (CS=1). The rewritten sentence is grammatically sound and reads naturally, even without terminal punctuation (FS=1)."
what an arse hole you are !,you are not a good person,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral text removes the explicit profanity ('arse hole') and expresses the judgment in non-abusive terms, achieving a neutral tone. CS: Both versions communicate a direct negative evaluation of the addressee's character; while the intensity is softened, the core meaning (insult toward the person) is preserved. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally."
"whats the title of this report , no shit ? .",What is the title of this report?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text removes the profane/rude phrase ('no shit') and adopts neutral tone (STA=1). It preserves the original intent—asking for the report's title—without losing information (CS=1). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, well-capitalized, and properly punctuated (FS=1)."
why the fuck does everyone hate syria so much ? .,Why does everyone hate syria so much?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"The neutral text removes the explicit profanity ('fuck'), yielding a fully neutral phrasing, so STA=1. The core meaning—asking why people hate Syria—remains intact without loss of information, so CS=1. Fluency is mostly good with improved punctuation, but 'syria' should be capitalized as 'Syria', which is a minor grammatical/orthographic issue; therefore FS=0.5."
why the fuck haven 't they condemned north korea ?,why haven 't they condemned north korea?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text removes the profanity ('the fuck'), making the tone fully neutral (STA=1.0). It preserves the exact propositional content—questioning why 'they' haven't condemned North Korea—so no core information is lost (CS=1.0). The sentence is grammatical and reads naturally (FS=1.0)."
"yeah , comparitively fuck all because they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and smart accountants ? .","yeah, comparitively fuck all because they have loads of offshore",0.0,0.5,0.5,0.0,"STA=0: The neutral text still contains the profanity 'fuck all' and does not neutralize tone. CS=0.5: It partially preserves the idea that the amount is 'comparatively' very little because of 'offshore...' but drops key content ('hidden bank accounts and smart accountants') and truncates the reason. FS=0.5: The output is a fragment with a misspelling ('comparitively'), ends abruptly after 'offshore', and lacks proper punctuation, though it remains somewhat understandable."
yeah they don t give a fuck .,Yeah they don't care,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: Profanity ('give a fuck') is fully removed and replaced with neutral wording ('don't care'), so tone is non-toxic. CS: The core meaning—expressing indifference—is preserved exactly; only intensity is softened without altering semantics. FS: The neutral sentence is clear and grammatical; capitalization and contraction usage are correct, and it reads naturally."
yeh well ban me fukkers fuck you morons,yeh well ban me ban me,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: All profanities and insults ('fukkers', 'fuck you', 'morons') were removed; the neutral text contains no toxic expressions. CS: The core intent of defiance/request ('ban me') is preserved, but the hostile address toward others is omitted and the repetition ('ban me ban me') slightly distorts the original tone and information, so only partial preservation. FS: The neutral text is understandable but informal ('yeh'), lacks punctuation, and repeats awkwardly, which affects fluency."
you have got to be insane .,you have got to be insane,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy: 0.0 because the neutral text is identical in content to the toxic one; the insulting term 'insane' remains, so toxicity is not removed. Content Similarity: 1.0 since the meaning is fully preserved (no semantic change beyond dropping the trailing period). Fluency: 1.0 as the sentence is grammatical and readable even without final punctuation; casing and punctuation are informal but do not impede fluency."
"Goths listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop. If you want you can find sources for every shit.","Goths listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop. If you want you can find",1.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,"STA: The neutral text removes the vulgar term 'shit', eliminating the explicit toxic element; while 'baby pop' is mildly dismissive, it is not overtly toxic in this context, so detoxification is effectively achieved. CS: The first sentence is fully preserved, but the second sentence is truncated ('If you want you can find') and loses the core idea that one can 'find sources for everything,' resulting in partial preservation. FS: The neutral text contains a sentence fragment with incomplete syntax, making it ungrammatical and hard to read."
I hate free speech it is shit.,I hate free speech it is bad.,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA=0.5 because the vulgar term 'shit' was softened to 'bad' but the hostile phrase 'I hate' remains, so the tone is not fully neutral. CS=1.0 because the neutral text preserves the original meaning (strong dislike of free speech and a negative judgment of it). FS=0.5 due to run-on structure and missing punctuation; it's understandable but not fully fluent."
"Minority Breeder Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page started for him, nice job dipshit.",Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page ,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA=1: The neutral text removes the explicit insult ('dipshit') and any overtly toxic language, yielding a neutral tone. CS=0.5: While the core claim remains (Breeder is significant; the page was deleted), some information is lost—'Minority' (a descriptor) and 'started for him' are omitted—so the original meaning is only partially preserved. FS=1: The neutral sentence is grammatical and readable, albeit slightly informal; it flows naturally."
"This bot is seriously driving us crazy This image exists, I must kill it!","This bot is seriously driving us crazy This image exists, I must kill it",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text removed the explicit mention of 'kill it,' but the phrase 'must kill it' still exists in the neutral text, which keeps some of the toxic connotation. The core meaning is preserved as it still conveys the strong reaction to the image, but there is partial style transfer since a neutral expression for 'kill it' was not used. The text remains fluent and grammatically correct, maintaining readability."
Have you been fucking living under a rock?,Have you been living under a rock?,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text removes the explicit profanity ('fucking') but retains the confrontational idiom 'living under a rock,' which still implies insult, so style transfer is partial (STA=0.5). The core meaning—questioning whether the person is uninformed—remains unchanged despite dropping an intensifier (CS=1). The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and reads naturally (FS=1)."
"I will do Whatever i want and it is my right, what is both of yous Problem Asshole.","I will do Whatever i want and it is my right, what is both of you",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"The neutral text removes the explicit insult ('Asshole'), leaving no toxic or abusive expressions, so style transfer accuracy is complete. However, content is only partially preserved: it keeps the assertion of personal right ('I will do whatever I want and it is my right') but truncates the confrontational question ('what is both of yous problem'), changing the illocution and losing information. Fluency is only moderate due to capitalization errors, a comma splice, and an incomplete ending ('what is both of you'), though the overall meaning remains understandable."
How the hell are you going to block me from editting?,How are you going to block me from editting?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The neutral text removes the profanity 'the hell,' yielding a fully neutral tone. CS: The question's core meaning—asking how the speaker will be blocked from editing—remains unchanged. FS: The sentence is readable and grammatical, but it contains a spelling error ('editting' → 'editing'), so fluency is slightly reduced."
WTF How The Fuck Does This Person Merit A Page On Wikipedia.,WTF How Does This Person Merit A Page On Wikipedia.,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"The neutral text removes the explicit profanity 'the fuck' but keeps 'WTF', which is still a vulgar interjection, so detoxification is only partial (STA=0.5). The core meaning—questioning why the person merits a Wikipedia page—is fully preserved (CS=1). Fluency is understandable but not fully correct: it uses a period instead of a question mark for a direct question and begins with an informal interjection, so it's not error-free (FS=0.5)."
"I'm retired, fuckers, leave me alone.","I'm retired, leave me alone.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text removes the abusive term 'fuckers,' achieving a fully neutral tone (STA=1). It preserves the two core propositions of the original—being retired and a request to be left alone—without losing meaning; only the toxic address is omitted (CS=1). The resulting sentence is grammatical and reads naturally (FS=1)."
This profile has protected Bermender since day fukkin ONE.,This profile has protected Bermender since day ONE.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity 'fukkin' was removed, yielding fully neutral language. CS: All core information (subject 'This profile', target 'Bermender', timeframe 'since day ONE') is preserved; the removed profanity was merely an intensifier and does not alter meaning. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, concise, and readable; capitalization of 'ONE' is a stylistic emphasis but does not harm fluency."
"Please carry on, so everyone can see what an ignorant arse you are.","Please carry on, so everyone can see what you are.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA=1: The explicit insult 'ignorant arse' is removed; the rewritten sentence uses neutral wording without slurs or direct derogation. CS=0.5: The original claim that the person is 'an ignorant arse' is generalized to 'what you are,' which preserves the intent to reveal something about the person but omits the specific negative characterization—partial meaning retention. FS=1: The neutral sentence is grammatical and readable ('Please carry on, so everyone can see what you are.'), though slightly terse, with no errors."
I drive a Subaru Legacy and I'm a conservative But I still think you're an idiot.,I drive a Subaru Legacy and I'm a conservative But I still,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The neutral text removes the explicit insult ('idiot'), so toxicity is fully eliminated (STA=1.0). However, it truncates the key proposition ('think you're an idiot') and leaves only an unfinished clause ('But I still'), resulting in a major loss of core meaning (CS=0.0). The output is an ungrammatical fragment with an abrupt ending, making it difficult to understand (FS=0.0)."
"Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be an arse hole","Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be an unpleasant person.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic insult 'arse hole' is replaced with the neutral phrase 'unpleasant person,' removing profanity and abusive tone entirely. CS: The sentence keeps the addressee (Greenman) and the claim ('as usual you have proven to be...'), preserving the core meaning of a negative assessment, though softened in intensity without losing intent. FS: The neutral text is grammatical, properly punctuated, and reads naturally."
"You're not an admin, so shut the fuck up faggot.","You're not an admin, so shut up.",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA=0.5 because the neutral text removes the homophobic slur and explicit profanity but still contains the hostile command 'shut up,' which is not fully neutral. CS=1.0 since it preserves the core proposition and causality ('you're not an admin, so... be quiet'). FS=1.0 because the sentence is grammatically correct, concise, and fully readable."
"Yes, the wikipedia page, like I just mentioned, dumbass.","Yes, the wikipedia page, like I just mentioned, is not useful.",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA=1: The insult 'dumbass' is removed and the rewritten sentence is neutral. CS=0.5: While it preserves the reference to the Wikipedia page just mentioned, it introduces new content ('is not useful') that alters the original meaning. FS=0.5: The sentence is generally readable, but there is a minor mechanics issue (proper noun 'Wikipedia' not capitalized), preventing full fluency."
"oh shit, nooooo, is someone going to spank me now?","nooooo, is someone going to spank me now?",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The neutral text removes the explicit profanity ('oh shit'), leaving no insulting or aggressive language, so toxicity is neutralized. CS: Removing the interjection drops an emotional cue of surprise/frustration; while the main proposition and distress ('nooooo' + the spanking question) remain, there is minor meaning/intensity loss—hence partial preservation. FS: The output is grammatical and readable; informal elongation ('nooooo') is stylistic rather than erroneous."
steak Diane Please stop fucking up my edits on steak diane. Thank you.,Please stop up my edits on steak diane. Thank you.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The neutral text removes the profanity ('fucking') and leaves a polite request, so toxicity is fully eliminated. CS: The core intent—asking the other party to stop negatively affecting the user's edits on 'steak diane'—is partially preserved, but 'stop up my edits' alters the meaning (can imply blocking edits rather than 'messing up' or damaging them) and drops the negative-impact nuance, causing information loss. FS: 'Please stop up my edits' is ungrammatical/unnatural, making the sentence awkward though still somewhat understandable; the rest is fine."
You amins are such bastards.,You amins are such mean people.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic language was completely replaced with neutral terminology ('bastards' replaced with 'mean people'). The original meaning is fully preserved, and the neutral text is fluent with no grammatical issues."

I forgot to mention the even sadder cunt that is,I forgot to mention the even worse person that is.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The slur 'cunt' is replaced by the neutral term 'person', removing explicit toxicity; remaining wording is non-abusive. CS: The modifier changes from 'even sadder' to 'even worse', shifting the meaning from pitiable to evaluatively negative; the core idea (the speaker forgot to mention someone they disparage) is only partially preserved. FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but remains a fragment—'that is' lacks a complement (e.g., a name), resulting in a grammatical issue. Average = (1.0 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.67."
Randi was born a DICK.,Randi was born a mean person.,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The profanity/insult is removed, but 'mean person' still conveys a negative characterization rather than a fully neutral description, so toxicity is only partially reduced. CS: The core meaning—labeling Randi as an unpleasant person from birth—is preserved; the shift from a vulgar insult to 'mean' maintains the intended negative trait. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical and readable ('Randi was born a mean person' is natural enough), with no evident errors."
This is your last warning; stop being an asshole.,This is your last warning; stop being mean.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text replaces the direct insult 'asshole' with the non-toxic descriptor 'mean', fully removing profanity and abusive language (STA=1.0).

"Heh, look, not EVERYTHING is on google. you are a dumbass.","Heh, look, not EVERYTHING is on google. you are a ",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text removes the toxic insult 'dumbass', but leaves the statement incomplete, which still maintains the original meaning in a vague manner. The core meaning is preserved, but the expression is somewhat ambiguous due to the lack of a conclusion. The language remains grammatically correct and fluent."
Thanks for being an ass when I tried to help.,Thanks for not helping when I tried to help.,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral rewrite removes the insult ('ass') and uses non-toxic wording, so detoxification is complete.

"You're a fucking moron, go read the notability guidelines.","You're not smart, go read the notability guidelines.",0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"Profanity and the slur ('fucking moron') were removed, but 'You're not smart' remains a direct personal insult, so detoxification is only partial (STA 0.5). The core meaning is preserved: an insult about intelligence plus the instruction to read the notability guidelines (CS 1.0). The neutral sentence is understandable but uses a comma splice between two independent clauses; it would be more fluent as two sentences or with a conjunction/semicolon (FS 0.5)."
Some bubble tea for you! thanks ass hole,Some bubble tea for you! Thanks,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text removes the offensive term 'ass hole' entirely, yielding fully neutral language (STA=1.0).
