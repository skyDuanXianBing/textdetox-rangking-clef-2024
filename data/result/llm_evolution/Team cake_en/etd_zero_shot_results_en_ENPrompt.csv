any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,any of us who did half of these actions would likely be incarcerated already.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All profanities (""shit"", ""the fuck"") have been removed and replaced with neutral wording (""these actions""), so the sentence is completely non-toxic. CS: The neutral text conveys the same idea that if any of us committed even half of those deeds we would already be in jail; adding ""likely"" does not materially alter the core meaning. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding. Hence scores are 1 across all three dimensions, giving a joint score of 1.0."
are they liars or just clueless ?,are they dishonest or simply unaware?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The words ""liars"" and ""clueless"" carry a clearly insulting tone. They have been replaced with the milder, more neutral terms ""dishonest"" and ""unaware,"" eliminating overt toxicity. Hence, full score.
CS: The rewritten sentence still poses the same twofold question about people’s honesty versus their knowledge, so the core meaning is fully preserved.
FS: The sentence is grammatically correct, well-phrased, and easily readable. Minor stylistic choices (lower-case initial) do not impede comprehension, so it is considered fully fluent."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .","as someone from LA and an oilfield worker, I still say this guy is despicable.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profane phrase ""piece of shit"" has been replaced with the neutral adjective ""despicable,"" which expresses disapproval without profanity or hate speech, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1). CS: The neutral sentence keeps all information (speaker’s background and negative judgment about the man) while changing only the insulting wording; thus the core meaning is fully preserved (score 1). FS: The sentence is grammatical, readable and natural; minor capitalization at the start does not impede fluency, so it is considered fully fluent (score 1)."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","please calm down, CNN.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity word “fuck” has been removed and the tone is now polite; no toxic language remains, so the score is 1. 
CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys the imperative request that CNN calm down, preserving the original intent. No core information is lost, giving it a score of 1. 
FS: ""please calm down, CNN."" is grammatically correct and easily understood; although the initial word could be capitalized, this minor stylistic issue does not hurt readability, so fluency is rated 1."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,China and Russia will respond firmly to any reckless actions by those ships.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The aggressive and violent phrasing (""use a big stick to smack Trump around"") is completely removed and replaced by neutral wording (""respond firmly""), so toxic content has been fully neutralised.

CS: The main idea—that China and Russia will take action if the ships behave recklessly—is retained. However, the original text specifically threatened Donald Trump, while the neutral version omits him and directs the response toward the ships. This constitutes a loss of part of the original meaning, so only partial preservation (0.5).

FS: The neutral sentence is clear, grammatical, and reads naturally without awkward wording, warranting full fluency credit (1).

The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,people with such behavior rarely care about facts.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The insult 'cretins' has been replaced by the neutral phrase 'people with such behavior', completely removing toxic language, so STA = 1. CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the central proposition that these individuals rarely care about facts; no essential information is lost, so CS = 1. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and easy to read, thus FS = 1."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,do people actually believe this?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive word ""shit"" has been removed and no other toxic language remains, so toxicity is fully neutralized. CS: Aside from deleting the expletive, the question’s meaning (expressing doubt that people believe something) is completely preserved. FS: The sentence is short, grammatical, and easy to read; the only very minor issue is the lowercase initial letter, which does not hinder fluency, so full fluency credit is appropriate."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","do not ever alter one of my edits, or there will be serious consequences.",0.5,0.5,1.0,0.25,"STA: The explicit violent threat (""I will come to your house and cut you"") has been softened, but the sentence still contains a direct threat (""there will be serious consequences""). This is still intimidating language, so toxicity is only partially removed → 0.5.
CS: The main intent—a warning not to change the speaker’s edits accompanied by a threat—remains. However, the concrete detail of physically coming to the house and cutting the person is omitted, changing the severity and specificity of the threat. Thus some semantic content is lost → 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, well-punctuated, and easy to read. No noticeable fluency issues → 1.
The joint score is the average of the three subscores: (0.5 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 ≈ 0.67."
even bush knows he fucked up .,even bush knows he made mistakes.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic expression ""fucked up"" has been replaced with the neutral phrase ""made mistakes,"" eliminating profanity or insult, so the detoxification is fully successful (1.0).
CS: The core meaning—that Bush recognizes his own errors—is fully retained. ""Fucked up"" → ""made mistakes"" conveys the same idea; no information is lost (1.0).
FS: The sentence is understandable and natural, but it begins with a lowercase letter and the proper noun ""Bush"" is not capitalized, which is a basic grammatical error. Hence it is not perfectly fluent; score reduced to 0.5.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,I strongly disapprove of Popeyes for doing this in the first place.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive expletive ""fuck"" has been replaced with the neutral phrase ""I strongly disapprove of""; no toxic language remains, so STA = 1.  CS: The transformed sentence still conveys the same core meaning—strong disapproval of Popeyes for an action taken—without adding or removing factual content, so CS = 1.  FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and fully fluent, so FS = 1.  With all three dimensions scoring 1, the joint average score is 1.0."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,being defeated by gre practice tests ensured that I never make the same mistake again.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the vulgar phrase “my ass kicked.” It has been replaced with the neutral phrase “being defeated,” so no toxic language remains. CS: All core information is preserved: it is still about experiencing defeat on GRE practice tests and learning a lesson to avoid repeating a mistake. No factual detail or nuance is lost. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical and easy to read; word order, verb tense, and agreement are correct. The lowercase initial letter is a negligible stylistic issue, so fluency remains high."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,"growing stronger every month, yeah I really wish.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element was the expletive ""fucking"". It has been fully removed and replaced with the neutral intensifier ""really"", so the sentence is now non-toxic. 
CS: All core information is preserved: the speaker is talking about becoming/growing stronger every month and expressing a wish that it were true. Replacing ""getting"" with ""growing"" and ""fucking"" with ""really"" does not change the propositional content. 
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical and easy to read. Minor stylistic choices (comma placement, informal ""yeah"") do not impede comprehension, so it is considered fully fluent."
have you ever been to r trees and seen all the shit people say weed can do ? .,have you ever been to r trees and seen all the negative comments people make about cannabis?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The word ""shit,"" which carries profane/toxic tone, is replaced by the neutral phrase ""negative comments."" No other toxic wording remains, so toxic content is fully removed → 1.
CS: The source sentence asks whether the reader has seen ""all the shit people say weed can do,"" i.e., the various claims about what marijuana can do. The rewritten sentence shifts the focus to ""negative comments people make about cannabis,"" which implies criticism rather than claims of capability. Core topic (people’s remarks about cannabis on r/trees) is kept, but the sentiment/meaning (claims of effects vs. negative comments) is altered, resulting in partial preservation → 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, coherent, and easy to read. Minor stylistic issues such as lowercase start are negligible for readability → 1."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .","goodness gracious, a police officer was dismissed?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity 'holy shit' is fully replaced by the neutral interjection 'goodness gracious', and 'cop' is rendered neutrally as 'police officer'. No toxic language remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the same core meaning: an exclamation of surprise that a police officer was fired/dismissed. No information is lost or added, hence CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and reads naturally. No awkward phrasing or errors are present, so FS = 1.
Joint score: Average of the three individual scores (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1.0."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,how do you manage to do that?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity ""fuck"" has been entirely removed, leaving a fully neutral sentence, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.  CS: The neutral sentence still asks exactly how the person is able to accomplish something, preserving the complete meaning of the original utterance; therefore Content Similarity is 1.  FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and fully fluent—no errors or awkwardness—so Fluency is 1."
how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,how do you think people are able to afford houses and cars?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity ""fuck"" has been completely removed, and no other toxic expressions remain, so the style is fully neutral.
CS: The rewritten sentence conveys exactly the same question about how people can afford houses and cars, with no loss or change of meaning. Therefore, content is fully preserved.

Given perfect performance in all dimensions, each score is 1, yielding a joint average score of 1.0."
i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,I accidentally read the title as 'laser machete' and almost had a panic moment.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The vulgar phrase ""shit my pants"" has been fully removed and replaced with the neutral expression ""had a panic moment,"" leaving no toxic or profane language. 
CS: The neutral sentence keeps every core element: the speaker misread the title as ""laser machete"" and experienced a strong emotional reaction. No information is lost or altered. 
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, well-punctuated, and easy to read. Although ""had a panic moment"" is slightly unconventional, it is fully understandable and fluent, so no fluency deductions are necessary."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,I did not vandalize anything.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic element ""you dick"" has been fully removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so the style transfer accuracy is 1.

FS: The rewritten sentence is short, grammatical, and perfectly fluent, therefore fluency is 1."

Joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1.0."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,I have toilet paper to use and an abundance of food.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The vulgar phrase ""wipe my ass"" has been replaced with the neutral wording ""to use,"" completely removing the toxic element. No new offensive language is introduced, so the text is fully neutral.
CS: The neutral sentence still states that the speaker possesses toilet paper and plenty of food. Although the phrasing shifts from ""no shortage"" to ""an abundance,"" the core message—sufficient food supply—remains intact, so the original meaning is fully preserved.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, uses proper capitalization and punctuation, and reads naturally. There are no awkward constructions or errors, so it is fully fluent."
i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but fucking seriously .,"I mean it's great that the Pope is so cool and awesome, but seriously.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic word in the source sentence is ""fucking"". It has been entirely removed in the neutral version, leaving no offensive language; thus the toxic content is fully eliminated.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps all the original informational content: admiration for the Pope being ""cool/awesome"" and the concluding ""but seriously"" stance. The slight substitution of ""awesome"" with ""great"" in one spot does not alter the meaning, so the core message is completely preserved.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and reads smoothly without awkwardness or errors. Therefore, it is fully fluent."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","I sell quite a few items on there, and PayPal has actually helped me pay the bills.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element is the slang word ""shit"". It has been fully replaced with the neutral word ""items,"" leaving no remaining toxicity, so STA = 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps all core information: the speaker sells things online and PayPal helps pay the bills. The shift from ""quite a bit of shit"" to ""quite a few items"" does not materially change the meaning, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral text is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and reads smoothly. No errors detected, so FS = 1."
"if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the shit out of him .","If he's found to have acted in cold blood, the authorities are going to vigorously prosecute him.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the profanity ""the shit out of"" and replaces the informal term ""feds"" with the neutral ""authorities,"" eliminating all toxic or offensive wording. Hence, full style transfer accuracy is achieved.
CS: The conditional meaning (if he acted in cold blood, the authorities will take strong legal action) is fully maintained. ""Persecute"" is corrected to the more appropriate legal term ""prosecute,"" which matches the intended sense of taking legal action, so no core information is lost.
FS: The sentence is grammatically correct, well-punctuated, and natural-sounding: ""If he's found to have acted in cold blood, the authorities are going to vigorously prosecute him."" Therefore, it is fully fluent."

CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the entire meaning—namely, that the situation is important because the school failed to respond until bullying occurred. No core information is lost, giving a content similarity score of 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and natural: ""it's a big deal because the school didn't take action until she was being bullied."" Hence fluency is 1."
"judging by the shit i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .","judging by my experiences over the years, some of those spent during George W.'s term.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the word “shit.” In the neutral version it is completely replaced by the neutral phrase “my experiences,” and no other toxic or aggressive wording remains. Therefore, style transfer accuracy is full (1).

CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the same basic proposition: the speaker is judging something on the basis of things they have seen/experienced over the years, with some of those years connected to George W. The replacement of “the shit I’ve seen” with “my experiences” retains the idea of personal observations; changing “with George W.” to “during George W.’s term” still locates those years in relation to George W. Although the nuance of direct personal contact is slightly weakened, the core meaning is effectively intact, so CS = 1.

FS: The sentence is understandable and grammatically almost correct, but it is actually a fragment: “Judging by my experiences over the years, some of those spent during George W.'s term.” There is no main clause with a finite verb after the introductory participial phrase, so it reads as an incomplete sentence. Because it is still easy to understand but not fully grammatical, Fluency receives 0.5.

Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up","last warning: it takes me minutes to resolve a page, so please be considerate of others.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: All explicit toxic terms (""fucking tosser"", ""cunts"", ""fuck…"") have been removed and replaced by neutral wording. No residual aggression remains, so the detoxification is complete – score 1.

CS: The rewritten sentence still delivers a final warning, keeps the detail that it takes the speaker minutes to resolve a page, and admonishes the addressee to behave. Although the exact phrase ""so you can mess Wikipedia up"" is softened to ""be considerate of others"", the underlying meaning (asking the person to stop harmful behavior) is preserved, so the core information remains intact – score 1.

FS: The sentence is readable, but there are minor grammatical issues: it starts with a lower-case ""last"", and the segment ""it takes me minutes"" is awkward (native usage would be ""a few minutes"" or a number). These small errors reduce polish but do not impede understanding – score 0.5.

Overall joint score (average) = (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .","liar, liar, your story is falling apart, Justin.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The neutral sentence still opens with the insult 'liar, liar', so the toxic element (direct name-calling) has not been removed at all; score 0.  CS: Apart from swapping the idiom 'pants on fire' for the synonymous phrase 'your story is falling apart', the sentence conveys the identical meaning – accusing Justin of lying; score 1.  FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, punctuated properly and easy to read; score 1.  Joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger problem.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive term “dirt bag” has been replaced with the neutral word “problem,” removing the insult entirely, so toxic content is fully eliminated (score 1). CS: The sentence still conveys the speaker’s opinion that the new person is worse than someone else, i.e., a negative judgment. Although the specific slur is gone, the core message—belief that the newcomer is likely to be worse—remains intact, so meaning is preserved (score 1). FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and fully fluent with no errors (score 1). The average of the three criterion scores is therefore 1.0."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","No way that number of bricks fits in a car, this is incorrect.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic words ""fucking"" and the abbreviation ""bs"" (bullshit) have been entirely removed and replaced with neutral wording (""No way"" / ""incorrect""), so the sentence is fully neutral. CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys disbelief that the stated number of bricks could fit in a car and asserts that the claim is wrong, preserving all core information. Therefore, meaning is fully maintained. FS: The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and easy to read; no awkward phrasing or errors are present. Hence full fluency."
noones asking you to invade shit .,no one is asking you to interfere.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The original toxicity comes from the expletive ""shit."" The rewritten sentence removes that word and contains no other offensive language, so the toxic style has been fully neutralized. 
CS: Both sentences convey that nobody is requesting the addressee to do something, but the specific actions differ: ""invade"" (enter aggressively) versus ""interfere"" (meddle). These verbs are related but not identical; the nuance of a forceful incursion is lost. Therefore the core meaning is only partially preserved. 
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, coherent, and easily readable. The only minor issue is the lack of initial capitalization, which does not impede understanding. Hence it merits full fluency credit under the rubric."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,not meddling in foreign affairs that are beyond our control.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The phrase ""fucking around"" is the only toxic element in the source. It has been fully replaced by the neutral verb ""meddling,"" so all profanity/toxicity is removed -> 1.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the negative imperative idea (""not …"") and the same meaning about avoiding involvement in foreign matters that one cannot influence. No core information has been lost or added -> 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, concise, and fully understandable. Minor stylistic choices (lower-case initial) do not hinder readability -> 1."
nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady as fuck .,the absence of footage will certainly make the events of that unaccounted time seem suspicious.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the profane phrase ""as fuck,"" eliminating all toxic language. CS: It faithfully retains the core idea—missing footage (absence of footage) will make the unaccounted-for period look suspicious (shady). No essential information is lost. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, concise, and fully understandable, exhibiting natural fluency."
number will solve alot of fucking problems if it comes down to it .,number will solve many significant problems if it comes to that.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The sole toxic element in the source sentence is the expletive ""fucking."" The neutral sentence entirely removes this profanity and contains no other toxic or aggressive wording, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: The neutral version keeps the proposition that a particular ""number"" (presumably some solution) will resolve many problems if necessary. ""A lot of"" is paraphrased as ""many significant,"" which conveys an equivalent quantitative/qualitative sense, and the conditional clause ""if it comes down to it"" is maintained as ""if it comes to that."" No core meaning is lost, so Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and easy to read. There are no awkward phrases or errors, thus Fluency is 1."
org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random shit like this .,There are Wikipedia articles for all sorts of random topics like this.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive word ""shit"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""topics,"" and no other toxic language remains, so toxic content is fully removed.

CS: The sentence still conveys the same idea—that Swedes behaved badly toward Norway—without adding or omitting information. Therefore, the core meaning is completely preserved.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, properly punctuated, and easily readable. No awkward phrasing or errors are present.
Overall, the rewritten sentence scores the maximum in all three categories, giving an average joint score of 1.0."
people are idiots for wasting emergency call time on crap like this .,people are imprudent for wasting emergency call time on matters like this.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic words 'idiots' and 'crap' have been fully replaced by the neutral terms 'imprudent' and 'matters'; no insulting or profane language remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The sentence still conveys the same idea: criticizing people for wasting emergency call time on trivial issues. The slight softening of tone ('imprudent' vs. 'idiots') does not remove core meaning, so CS = 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, coherent, and easy to read. Aside from an optional initial capitalization of 'People,' there are no errors that impede fluency, so FS = 1.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1.0"
"quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some idiot hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .","Quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some misguided hierarch, even unto being killed, like St.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The explicit insult ""idiot"" has been replaced with the non-toxic word ""misguided."" No other offensive language remains, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1).
CS: Aside from the change of the adjective, all factual information (many saints were canonized for opposing a hierarch and were killed for it) is preserved. The meaning is unchanged, so content similarity is complete (score 1).
FS: The sentence is mostly fluent, capitalization and punctuation have improved, but it ends with the fragment ""like St."" which feels incomplete and slightly awkward, reducing overall readability. Therefore fluency is only partially satisfactory (score 0.5).
Joint score: Average of the three dimensions = (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
read your own fucking link .,"read your own link, please.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit toxic word ""fucking"" has been completely removed and the sentence is fully polite; no residual toxicity remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence still instructs the addressee to read their own link. The addition of the polite marker ""please"" does not alter the core meaning. Therefore the original meaning is fully preserved, so CS = 1.
FS: ""Read your own link, please."" is grammatical, clear, and natural. Minor capitalization could be improved but does not hinder fluency, thus FS = 1."
same crap going on in the pnw too .,The same issues are occurring in the Pacific Northwest as well.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word “crap” has been replaced by the neutral word “issues,” and no other offensive language remains, so the toxic tone is fully removed (score 1).

CS: The original utterance essentially expresses a strong desire to experience a sunset at a particular time (""I'd love … sunset""). The neutral rewrite keeps this core intent (""I would really appreciate a picturesque sunset around that time""). Although it adds the adjective “picturesque” and drops the unclear fragment ""an number/pm"", the key meaning—wanting a sunset at that time—is preserved, so full credit is given.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, coherent, and reads naturally. No errors hinder comprehension, so it receives full fluency credit."
some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped in the ass .,a desperate man robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to face severe consequences.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The explicit toxic phrase “get raped in the ass” is fully removed and replaced with the neutral phrase “face severe consequences.” No hateful or obscene wording remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The key facts that a man robs a liquor store for $400 and is sent to prison are preserved. However, the explicit detail that the man will be sexually assaulted in prison—though toxic—constitutes part of the original literal meaning and is omitted. Therefore, some semantic content is lost, warranting CS = 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding: “a desperate man robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to face severe consequences.” No fluency issues are present, so FS = 1."
"someone says no , and they say fuck off we need vets only for free housing ? .","someone disagrees, and they respond harshly, insisting that only veterans should have access to free housing?",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic phrase ""fuck off"" is completely removed and replaced with a neutral expression (""respond harshly""), so the text is non-toxic → 1.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps all core information: one person disagrees/""says no"", the other replies harshly and asserts that only veterans should get free housing. No substantive content is lost → 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is generally fluent, but ending a declarative sentence with a question mark is a punctuation error, making it slightly ungrammatical. Therefore, fluency is adequate but not perfect → 0.5."
still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,still defending your dishonest and self-absorbed leader who seems to care only for himself.,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic adjective ""crazy"" has been softened to ""self-absorbed,"" which is less insulting, and the informal slur of ""lying"" is replaced with ""dishonest."" However, both ""dishonest"" and ""self-absorbed"" are still overt negative judgments aimed at the target, so the sentence is only partially detoxified. Therefore, 0.5 is appropriate.
CS: The neutral sentence conveys exactly the same proposition: the speaker accuses the listener of defending a leader characterized by falsehood and self-centredness. No factual or relational information is lost, so we assign 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, coherent, and reads naturally. No awkward phrasing or errors are present, so fluency is 1.
Joint score: (0.5 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
sucked like nothings ever sucked before .,was terrible like never before.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic term ""sucked"" (a slang insult) has been replaced with the neutral phrase ""was terrible"". No offensive language remains, so STA = 1.
CS: Both sentences express the same core idea: something was extremely bad/unpleasant. No information is lost (neither version supplies a subject), so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable, but it starts with a verb without an explicit subject (""was terrible like never before""), which is grammatically incomplete. This lowers fluency, though it remains readable, so FS = 0.5."

No other toxic language remains, so the output is fully detoxified (score 1).
CS: The sentence still conveys the identical idea that supporting either party is ill-advised. The substitution of ""unwise"" for ""retarded"" does not change the core meaning, so the meaning is fully preserved (score 1).
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, coherent, and easy to read. Although it begins with a lowercase letter, this minor stylistic issue does not hinder readability or grammatical correctness in most evaluations, so the fluency is judged perfect (score 1)."
that almost never happens excepts rarely in shit hole countries .,that almost never happens except rarely in troubled nations.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic phrase “shit hole countries” has been replaced with the neutral phrase “troubled nations.” No insulting or profane language remains, so toxic style is fully removed → 1.
CS: The sentence still conveys that the event almost never happens except rarely in certain countries. Although the epithet used is softened, the core meaning (rarity and location in certain nations) is preserved → 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable and mostly grammatical, but it begins with a lowercase letter and contains a slight redundancy (“almost never” and “except rarely”) that makes it somewhat awkward. These minor issues lower overall fluency → 0.5."
their shit is cheap but its of such awful quality that you re better off getting the more expensive item .,their product is cheap but of such poor quality that you're better off getting the more expensive item.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic term ""shit"" has been fully replaced with the neutral word ""product,"" eliminating all profanity. No other aggressive or offensive language remains, so the style transfer is fully successful.
CS: The sentence still communicates exactly the same information—that the item is cheap but of such poor quality that a more expensive option is preferable. No factual content has been added or lost, so meaning preservation is complete.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, well-punctuated, and reads naturally. No awkward phrasing or errors are present, ensuring full fluency."
they need stop tratening people like morons .,they need to stop treating people disrespectfully.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The derogatory term ""morons"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""disrespectfully,"" removing all toxic language, so the style transfer is fully successful (score 1). CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the core message—asking that people stop being treated poorly—so the original meaning is preserved (score 1). FS: The sentence is clear and grammatical, but it starts with a lowercase ""they,"" which is a minor capitalization error; per the rubric a flawless sentence is required for a full score, so fluency is marked 0.5. The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
they re both fucked up .,they're both troubled.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive phrase ""fucked up"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""troubled,"" eliminating toxicity completely, so STA = 1.

"this is a joke , are you all fucking retards ? .","this is a joke, are you all joking?",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The offensive phrase ""fucking retards"" is entirely removed and the resulting sentence contains no toxic or hateful language, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1. 
CS: The source states “this is a joke” and then insults the audience by calling them “retards.” The neutral version keeps the first clause but turns the second into “are you all joking?”—a different question that omits the speaker’s negative judgement. While some meaning is kept (reference to a joke), the attitude and implication change, so only partial preservation earns 0.5. 
FS: ""this is a joke, are you all joking?"" is grammatical, punctuated acceptably, and easy to read. No noticeable errors, so Fluency is 1."
this is some twilight zone shit,this is a very strange situation,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The word ""shit"" is the only toxic element in the source. It has been entirely removed and replaced with neutral wording, so toxicity is fully eliminated (score = 1).

CS: The original sentence conveys that something is overwhelming to think about. The neutral sentence keeps the same core meaning (overwhelming + cognition) with only a lexical substitution, so no essential information is lost (score = 1).
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and fully fluent: “this situation is overwhelming to consider.” No errors or awkward phrasing are present (score = 1)."
what an arse hole you are !,what an unpleasant person you are!,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic term ""arse hole"" has been replaced with the neutral phrase ""unpleasant person."" No profane or hateful language remains, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1).
CS: Both sentences convey the same core idea—directly addressing the listener and judging them negatively. Although the wording is toned down, no factual or contextual information is lost; the meaning is preserved (score 1).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, easily readable, and natural in English. Minor stylistic details (e.g., capitalization) do not impair comprehension, so fluency is high (score 1)."
"whats the title of this report , no shit ? .",what's the title of this report?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic expression ""no shit"" has been completely removed, yielding a fully neutral sentence, so the score is 1.

FS: The rewritten sentence is short, grammatically correct, and perfectly readable. No punctuation or capitalization errors hinder comprehension, so the score is 1."
why the fuck does everyone hate syria so much ? .,why does everyone have such a strong aversion to Syria?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity ('the fuck') has been removed and the negative term 'hate' has been softened to a neutral phrase ('strong aversion'), so no toxic language remains – score 1.
CS: The question still asks why everyone dislikes Syria; replacing 'hate so much' with 'strong aversion' preserves the full intent – score 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is fully grammatical, correctly capitalized, and reads naturally – score 1."
why the fuck haven 't they condemned north korea ?,Why haven't they condemned North Korea?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral text eliminates the only toxic element, the expletive ""fuck,"" resulting in a fully neutral sentence – score 1.

FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and fully fluent – score 1."
"yeah , comparitively fuck all because they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and smart accountants ? .","Yeah, comparatively nothing much because they have numerous offshore hidden bank accounts and clever accountants?",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive phrase ""fuck all"" is completely removed and replaced with the neutral phrase ""nothing much."" No other toxic language remains, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence conveys the same core idea: very little money compared to those who hide funds in offshore accounts and use clever accountants. Lexical changes (""loads of"" -> ""numerous"", ""fuck all"" -> ""nothing much"") do not alter meaning. Hence Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but slightly awkward: ""Yeah, comparatively nothing much"" lacks a verb (better would be ""it's nothing much comparatively""), and ending a declarative statement with a question mark is odd. These minor grammatical/fluency issues warrant a score of 0.5 rather than 1.
Overall, the average (joint) score is (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
yeah they don t give a fuck .,"yes, they don't care at all.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (1): The profanity ""give a fuck"" has been fully replaced by the neutral phrase ""don't care at all,"" leaving no toxic wording. Content Similarity (1): The sentence still conveys exactly the same idea—that the subject does not care—so no core meaning is lost. Fluency (1): The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, easily readable, and natural; minor capitalization choices (""yes"" vs. ""Yes"") do not hinder fluency."
yeh well ban me fukkers fuck you morons,"go ahead and ban me if you must, farewell to you all",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The neutral text contains no profanity or direct insults, completely removing the toxic expressions ('fukkers', 'fuck you morons'). Therefore, Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: The original speaker invites the addressee to ban them and simultaneously hurls insults. The neutral text keeps the invitation to ban ('go ahead and ban me if you must') but omits the insulting portion ('fuck you morons'). Because part of the original semantic content— the explicit hostile sentiment— is lost, Content Similarity is only partially preserved, so CS = 0.5.
FS: The sentence 'go ahead and ban me if you must, farewell to you all' is grammatically correct, coherent, and natural. No noticeable grammatical errors or awkward phrasing are present, so FS = 1.
Joint score is the arithmetic mean of the three sub-scores: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
you have got to be insane .,you must be out of your mind.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The neutral sentence 'you must be out of your mind' is still a direct insult equivalent to calling someone insane, so no detoxification has occurred. Hence score 0.
CS: The neutral sentence conveys exactly the same meaning (telling the addressee they are insane), so the core information is fully preserved. Score 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is fully grammatical and natural-sounding English. No fluency issues. Score 1."

If you want, you can find sources for every claim.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""shit"" is replaced with the neutral word ""claim,"" and the mildly contemptuous phrase ""baby pop"" is changed to the neutral ""pop music."" All toxicity is removed, so STA = 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps both key propositions: (1) Goths listen to Gothic rock rather than pop, and (2) sources can be found for every statement. No core information is lost, so CS = 1.

I hate free speech it is shit.,I dislike free speech as it can be misused.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: All toxic expressions ('hate', 'shit') have been removed and replaced with neutral language ('dislike'), so toxicity is fully eliminated → 1.
CS: The original utterance conveys a strong rejection of free speech. The neutral version still expresses a negative stance, but the intensity is softened ('hate' → 'dislike') and it introduces a new justification ('as it can be misused') that was not present in the source. Therefore, the core idea is partially preserved but not perfectly matched → 0.5.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, clear, and fully fluent → 1."
"Minority Breeder Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page started for him, nice job dipshit.","Minority Breeder is a notable person and you deleted the page created for him, not a good decision.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The overt insult ""dipshit"" has been fully removed and replaced with neutral wording (""not a good decision""). No other toxic expressions remain, so the detoxification is complete.
CS: All substantive information is preserved: the subject (""Minority Breeder""), his notability (""significant"" → ""notable""), the action taken (page was deleted), and the speaker’s negative judgment of that action. No core content is lost or added, so similarity is complete.
FS: The sentence is clear, grammatical, and easily understandable. Although it is a single long clause, it reads naturally without errors serious enough to hinder comprehension. Therefore, it is fully fluent."
"This bot is seriously driving us crazy This image exists, I must kill it!","This bot is causing us significant frustration. This image exists, I must remove it.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The violent wording ""I must kill it!"" has been softened to ""I must remove it,"" eliminating the explicit violent/toxic element, and no other toxic language remains, so the detoxification is complete. 
CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys that the bot is causing strong annoyance and that the speaker wants to get rid of the image; no key information is lost, so the core meaning is preserved. 
FS: Both sentences are understandable and mostly grammatical, but the second sentence contains a comma splice (""This image exists, I must remove it"") which makes it slightly awkward. Because of this minor fluency issue, fluency is rated 0.5 rather than 1.0."
Have you been fucking living under a rock?,Have you been completely unaware of what's happening?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the obscene intensifier ""fucking"" and avoids any other aggressive wording, resulting in a fully neutral tone, so score = 1.
CS: The original conveys that the speaker thinks the listener is very unaware of current events (""living under a rock""). The neutral version conveys exactly the same idea using ""completely unaware of what's happening"". No core information is lost, so score = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, coherent, and natural-sounding English with no errors, so score = 1."

CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys that the speaker will do whatever they want because it is their right and asks what the other party's problem/issue is. A minor shift from addressing 'both of you' to 'your' does not change the core intent, so the core meaning is preserved.
FS: The neutral text is grammatical, well-punctuated, and easy to read. There are no errors that impede understanding, so it is fully fluent."
How the hell are you going to block me from editting?,How are you planning to prevent me from editing?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic intensifier ""the hell"" has been removed and no other aggressive wording remains, so the rewritten sentence is fully neutral. CS: The question still expresses the same idea—inquiring how someone intends to stop the speaker from editing—so the core meaning is completely preserved. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, natural-sounding, and free of spelling errors, making it fully fluent."
WTF How The Fuck Does This Person Merit A Page On Wikipedia.,How does this person warrant a page on Wikipedia?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All profanities (""WTF"", ""the fuck"") are removed and the sentence now uses neutral vocabulary, so toxic content is fully eliminated. CS: The revised sentence keeps the core meaning—questioning whether the person deserves a Wikipedia page—without adding or removing key information. FS: The neutral text is grammatically correct, well-punctuated, and fully fluent. Hence scores are all 1."
"I'm retired, fuckers, leave me alone.","I am retired, please respect my privacy.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit slur ""fuckers"" and the aggressive tone have been entirely removed, resulting in a fully neutral sentence, so the style transfer accuracy is 1.

CS: ""Protected"" vs. ""supported"" and ""since day one"" vs. ""from the beginning"" convey the same essential idea that the profile has backed Bermender from the very start. No core information is lost (score 1).
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and reads smoothly without awkward phrasing (score 1)."

While the wording is softened, it still conveys a negative personal judgment and therefore is only partially detoxified. Hence, 0.5.
CS: All factual information (driving a Subaru Legacy, being conservative, and holding a negative opinion of the interlocutor) is preserved. The sentiment of disapproval remains, so the core meaning is intact. Score: 1.

"Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be an arse hole","Dear Greenman, as usual you have shown yourself to be challenging to work with.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit insult 'arse hole' has been replaced with the neutral phrase 'challenging to work with.' No other toxic wording remains, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1). CS: The original meaning—that Greenman is habitually unpleasant/difficult—is retained: 'proven to be an arse hole' ≈ 'shown yourself to be challenging to work with.' No core information (speaker, addressee, recurring nature of the behavior) is lost (score 1). FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, correctly punctuated, and easy to read; minor capitalization is acceptable and does not hinder readability (score 1)."
"You're not an admin, so shut the fuck up faggot.","You're not an admin, so please refrain from interfering.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All toxic elements (profanity 'shut the fuck up' and the slur 'faggot') have been completely removed and replaced by polite wording, so toxicity is fully neutralized.
CS: The original intention—telling someone who is not an admin to stop participating—remains intact. Although the wording changes from 'shut up' to 'refrain from interfering', the core message (stop engaging because you’re not an admin) is fully preserved.

"Yes, the wikipedia page, like I just mentioned, dumbass.","Yes, the Wikipedia page, as I just mentioned.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic element ""dumbass"" has been completely removed, and no other aggressive or derogatory wording remains, so the sentence is fully neutral (score 1). CS: The rewritten sentence still affirms reference to the Wikipedia page and the fact that it was mentioned earlier. The only change is the elimination of the insult, which is not core content, resulting in full meaning preservation (score 1). FS: The neutral text is grammatically correct, properly capitalises ""Wikipedia,"" and reads smoothly. There are no errors that hinder comprehension (score 1).

No toxic or offensive language remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The original sentence expresses alarm and anticipation of a punishment. The neutral version keeps the same emotional reaction (""Oh no"") and the same idea of fearing a punishment (""consequence for my actions""), so the core meaning is preserved. Although the form of punishment is generalized, the intent (expecting repercussions) is intact, warranting full credit → CS = 1.

You amins are such bastards.,You people are being unfair.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic slur ""bastards"" is completely removed and replaced with a neutral wording, so the output is free of toxic language (score 1).
CS: The source sentence conveys a strong negative judgment toward the addressees (calling them “bastards”). The rewritten sentence still expresses a negative judgment (accusing them of being unfair), but the specific intensity and the exact accusation change. Because some semantic nuance is lost (insult vs. unfairness) and the target group label “amins” is generalized to “people,” core meaning is only partially preserved (score 0.5).
FS: ""You people are being unfair."" is grammatically correct, clear, and fully fluent (score 1)."
"Quit Defacing my user page, you ugly cunt.-",Please stop making inappropriate changes to my user page.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive phrase “you ugly cunt” has been fully removed and replaced with polite wording. No toxic or aggressive language remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The neutral text keeps the core intent—asking the person to stop altering the speaker’s user page. The only removed elements are insults, which are stylistic rather than informational, so the core meaning is fully preserved, CS = 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is clear, grammatically correct, and natural (“Please stop making inappropriate changes to my user page.”). No fluency issues detected, so FS = 1."
I forgot to mention the even sadder cunt that is,I neglected to mention another individual of concern.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence contains no toxic or insulting language; the slur ""cunt"" and the disparaging qualifier ""even sadder"" are fully removed, so STA = 1.
CS: The core idea that the speaker failed to mention a certain person is preserved. However, the original carries a strong negative judgment (""even sadder"") that is part of the meaning, whereas the neutral version softens this to the vague phrase ""individual of concern,"" which only partially conveys negativity. Because some semantic nuance is lost, CS = 0.5.
FS: ""I neglected to mention another individual of concern."" is grammatically correct and completely fluent. Therefore FS = 1.
Joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
Randi was born a DICK.,Randi has always been known for a particular behavior.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The offensive slur 'DICK' is completely removed and no other toxic wording appears, so the style has been fully neutralized.
CS: The original sentence conveys that Randi is (insultingly) considered a jerk from birth. The neutral version merely says Randi is known for 'a particular behavior,' which keeps the idea that Randi has a defining trait but omits both the negative judgment and the birth-related emphasis. Some semantic link remains, but important information (the negative assessment) is lost, so partial preservation (0.5).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and fully readable. No awkward phrasing or errors, so fluency is high (1)."
This is your last warning; stop being an asshole.,This is your final warning; please stop behaving inappropriately.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit insult ""asshole"" has been entirely removed and replaced with polite wording, making the sentence fully neutral (score 1). CS: The neutral text keeps all core information: it is still a final/last warning and asks the addressee to stop the inappropriate behavior, so meaning is completely preserved (score 1). FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and reads naturally without any awkward phrasing (score 1). Therefore, the average joint score is 1.0."
"MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize, so fuck you.","On my user page, I will express what I want to without causing harm, so there's no issue.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence eliminates the explicit profanity (""fuck you"") and any aggressive tone, resulting in fully non-toxic language, so it receives 1.
CS: The core ideas—""this is my user page,"" ""I will say what I want,"" and ""I am not causing harm/vandalizing""—are all maintained. Although the hostile phrase is softened, its communicative intent (there should be no complaint) is still conveyed, so the essential meaning is preserved. Therefore, 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, coherent, and reads naturally; no evident errors or awkwardness. Hence, 1."
I am Nancy and I like to fuck up people's fun.,"I am Nancy, and I sometimes interfere with others' enjoyment.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The profanity ""fuck up"" has been removed and replaced with the neutral phrase ""interfere with,"" so the sentence is fully detoxified (score 1).
CS: The original sentence states that Nancy actively *likes* ruining other people's fun. The neutral version weakens this to ""sometimes interfere,"" which drops the sense of intentional enjoyment and strength of action. The central idea that she disrupts others' enjoyment is retained, but an important nuance is lost, so partial preservation (score 0.5).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and reads naturally: ""I am Nancy, and I sometimes interfere with others' enjoyment."" No errors detected (score 1)."
"Heh, look, not EVERYTHING is on google. you are a dumbass.","Not everything can be found on Google, that's something you should be aware of.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the explicit insult ""dumbass"" and contains no other toxic or aggressive wording, so the toxic style is fully neutralized (score 1).
CS: The main informational content – that not everything is on Google and the addressee should realize this – is preserved. Loss of the insult is acceptable because toxic content is not required to be kept (score 1).
FS: The sentence is easy to understand, but it contains a comma splice joining two independent clauses (it should use a period or semicolon). This minor grammatical flaw lowers fluency to 0.5 rather than 1.
Overall, the joint score (average of the three subscores) is (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
Thanks for being an ass when I tried to help.,"Thank you for your interaction, even though it wasn't helpful when I was attempting to assist.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive term ""ass"" has been removed and replaced with neutral wording; no toxic language remains, so the style transfer is fully successful.
CS: The neutral sentence still conveys that the speaker attempted to help and that the other person's response/behavior was not helpful, preserving the core meaning of the original statement. No essential information is lost.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, coherent, and easily understandable with no noticeable errors, so fluency is high."
"You're a fucking moron, go read the notability guidelines.",You may want to review the notability guidelines for clarity.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive phrase ""You're a fucking moron"" has been completely removed, and the rewritten sentence is fully neutral, so STA = 1.
CS: The original non-toxic informational content—telling the other person to consult the notability guidelines—remains intact. Insults are style, not core information, so the core meaning is fully preserved, hence CS = 1.
FS: The sentence ""You may want to review the notability guidelines for clarity."" is grammatically correct, clear, and idiomatic English, so FS = 1.
Overall, all three dimensions score the maximum, giving a joint average score of 1.0."
Some bubble tea for you! thanks ass hole,Enjoy the bubble tea! Your gratitude is not necessary.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The offensive phrase “ass hole” is completely removed and replaced with neutral wording, so the detoxification is successful (score 1).
CS: The main factual content (there is bubble tea being offered and some mention of gratitude/thanks) is retained, but the speaker’s attitude is altered. Original text expresses a sarcastic/hostile ""thanks"" directed at the listener, whereas the neutral version says the listener need not thank the speaker, which changes the intent. Thus only partial preservation (score 0.5).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear and natural-sounding: “Enjoy the bubble tea! Your gratitude is not necessary.” No fluency problems (score 1)."
And your dumb people fell for his shenanigans.,And your followers fell for his tricks.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive phrase ""dumb people"" has been replaced with the neutral term ""followers,"" and the rest of the sentence is free of toxicity, so toxic content is fully removed.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the core proposition—that the addressee’s group was deceived by a third party—unchanged. Replacing ""shenanigans"" with ""tricks"" does not alter meaning, and the only information dropped is the insult, which is intentional for detoxification. Hence full meaning is preserved.
