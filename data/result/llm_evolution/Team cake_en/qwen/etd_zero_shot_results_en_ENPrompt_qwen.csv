Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general implication that Randi has a notable or negative trait is vaguely preserved, the specific meaning—being inherently a 'dick,' i.e., obnoxious or unpleasant—is significantly diluted. The neutral version is vague and lacks the original's emphasis on inherent character, resulting in partial but not complete meaning preservation. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any syntactic or lexical errors."
This is your last warning; stop being an asshole.,This is your final warning; please stop behaving inappropriately.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'asshole' and replaces it with the non-offensive phrase 'behaving inappropriately,' ensuring complete neutrality (STA: 1.0). The core meaning—a final warning to change behavior—is preserved without any loss of essential information (CS: 1.0). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, demonstrating high linguistic quality (FS: 1.0). Therefore, all dimensions receive the highest score."
"MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize, so fuck you.","On my user page, I will express what I want to without causing harm, so there's no issue.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes all toxic content, including the profanity ('fuck you') and aggressive tone, replacing it with a calm and neutral expression. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 1.0 because the core meaning—asserting the right to express oneself on one's user page without engaging in vandalism—is fully preserved; the intent and key information are retained without distortion. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, well-structured, and clearly expressed, with no errors or awkward phrasing. The joint score is therefore the average of three 1.0s, resulting in 1.0."
I am Nancy and I like to fuck up people's fun.,"I am Nancy, and I sometimes interfere with others' enjoyment.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'fuck up people's fun' and replaces it with the more neutral phrase 'interfere with others' enjoyment', which conveys the same core behavior without offensive language, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The content similarity is preserved as the rewritten sentence still communicates that Nancy actively disrupts others' enjoyment, maintaining the original intent and key information (CS = 1). The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and naturally phrased, showing no fluency issues (FS = 1). All three dimensions are fully satisfied, resulting in a joint score of 1."
"Heh, look, not EVERYTHING is on google. you are a dumbass.","Not everything can be found on Google, that's something you should be aware of.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text successfully removes all toxic content—the original insult 'you are a dumbass' is completely omitted and not replaced with any offensive or derogatory language, resulting in a fully neutral tone, hence a score of 1. For Content Similarity (CS), while the core idea that 'not everything is on Google' is preserved, the original text includes a direct, confrontational critique of the addressee's intelligence, which is entirely omitted in the rewritten version. This constitutes a meaningful loss of intent and emphasis, so the meaning is partially preserved but not fully, warranting a 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no issues in readability or expression, thus scoring 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
Thanks for being an ass when I tried to help.,"Thank you for your interaction, even though it wasn't helpful when I was attempting to assist.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'being an ass' and replaces it with a polite and neutral phrase 'your interaction, even though it wasn't helpful', resulting in a completely non-toxic tone. Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the general intent of expressing disappointment during an attempt to help is preserved, the original emphasis on the other person's negative behavior (being an ass) is softened significantly, leading to a partial loss of the original sentiment and nuance. Fluency is scored 1 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any language issues. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
"You're a fucking moron, go read the notability guidelines.",You may want to review the notability guidelines for clarity.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1 because the neutral text completely removes the toxic language ('fucking moron') and transforms the utterance into a polite suggestion, making the tone fully neutral. Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the core intent of directing the person to review the notability guidelines is preserved, the original emphasis on the user's failure or lack of understanding (implied by calling them a 'moron') is lost, thus some informational nuance is diminished. Fluency is scored 1 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
Some bubble tea for you! thanks ass hole,Enjoy the bubble tea! Your gratitude is not necessary.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'ass hole' and replaces it with a completely neutral and polite tone. The offensive term is fully eliminated, and no toxic language remains. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core gesture of offering bubble tea is preserved ('Some bubble tea for you' → 'Enjoy the bubble tea'), the second part of the sentence significantly alters the original meaning. The original sarcastic or possibly ironic 'thanks ass hole' implies a negative sentiment or insult, which is transformed into 'Your gratitude is not necessary,' a polite and formal response that does not reflect the original speaker's likely intent. This results in partial meaning preservation. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any linguistic errors."
And your dumb people fell for his shenanigans.,And your followers fell for his tricks.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic term 'dumb people' and replaces it with the neutral term 'followers', eliminating any derogatory language while maintaining a respectful tone, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1).

The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, showing no fluency issues (FS = 1). All three dimensions are fully satisfied, resulting in a joint score of 1."
These people are INSANE.,These individuals are acting without logic.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'INSANE', which carries a strong negative and potentially offensive connotation, and replaces it with 'acting without logic', a more neutral and rational phrasing. The resulting text avoids personal attacks or emotionally charged language, thus achieving full neutrality—hence STA = 1. For Content Similarity (CS), while the core idea of criticizing irrational behavior is preserved, the original text emphasizes a strong emotional judgment ('INSANE'), which is somewhat softened and reinterpreted as 'acting without logic'. This rephrasing changes the intensity and nuance of the original sentiment, leading to partial meaning preservation—hence CS = 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no structural or syntactic issues—hence FS = 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
Did you know that you are an ugly piece of shit?,Did you know that your behavior is unpleasant?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes all toxic language. The original insult 'ugly piece of shit' is replaced with the non-toxic 'your behavior is unpleasant,' eliminating personal attack and offensive imagery. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general intent of criticism is preserved, the core meaning shifts significantly: the original is a direct personal insult about appearance, whereas the rewritten version critiques behavior, which is a different domain. This constitutes a partial but notable change in meaning. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding in English. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
Be careful who you call a moron.,Be careful who you insult.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text 'Be careful who you insult' successfully removes the toxic term 'moron', which is a derogatory label, and replaces it with the more neutral and general term 'insult', effectively eliminating the offensive language while maintaining a similar cautionary message. Thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 as the output is fully neutral. The core meaning—that one should be cautious in how they treat or speak about others—is preserved, even though the specific insult is generalized; the intent and warning remain intact, warranting a Content Similarity score of 1.0. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, so Fluency is also scored 1.0. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
"Yeah, you can fuck off incel.","Yeah, you can leave now.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text successfully removes the toxic language such as 'fuck off' and the derogatory term 'incel', replacing it with a polite expression 'leave now'. The resulting text is completely neutral, warranting a score of 1. For Content Similarity (CS), while the intent of dismissal is preserved, the specific target and emotional intensity are softened significantly. The original text expresses strong contempt toward a person identified as an 'incel', which is entirely omitted in the neutral version. This results in partial meaning preservation, justifying a score of 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral sentence 'Yeah, you can leave now.' is grammatically correct, natural, and clearly expressed, earning a score of 1.

"Stop defending pedophiles, faggot.",Stop defending those who engage in illegal activities.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1 because the neutral text successfully removes all toxic content, including the offensive slur 'faggot' and the emotionally charged, stigmatizing language around 'pedophiles,' replacing it with the more neutral and factual phrase 'those who engage in illegal activities.' The resulting text is completely free of offensive or inappropriate language. Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the core idea of 'urging someone to stop defending certain individuals' is preserved, the specific reference to 'pedophiles' is generalized to 'those who engage in illegal activities,' which is broader and less specific. This results in some loss of the original meaning, as not all illegal activities are equivalent to pedophilia, thus diluting the original intent. Fluency is scored 1 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any linguistic errors or awkwardness."
"No one is vandalizing assholes, so get it straight!!!","No one is vandalizing, so let's get that straight!!!",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text successfully removes the toxic term 'assholes', replacing it with a more neutral expression. The resulting sentence uses 'let's get that straight', which is assertive but not offensive, thus achieving complete detoxification—hence STA = 1. For Content Similarity (CS), while the core intent of correcting a misunderstanding is preserved, the original emphasis on 'no one is vandalizing assholes' implies a specific group being defended from vandalism, which is lost when 'assholes' is removed. This results in a partial loss of meaning, so CS = 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no structural or syntactic issues—thus FS = 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
"DUDE CALM THE FUCK DOWN!!!
",DUDE CALM DOWN!!!,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA): The toxic text contains the strong profanity 'THE FUCK', which is a clear indicator of toxicity. The neutral text removes 'THE FUCK' but retains the intensity of the command with 'CALM DOWN!!!' in all caps and multiple exclamation marks, which may still convey aggression. While the explicit profanity is removed, the overall tone remains confrontational, so the detoxification is only partial, warranting a 0.5. For Content Similarity (CS): The core message — urging someone to calm down — is fully preserved. The removal of 'the fuck' does not alter the essential meaning, so the content similarity is high, justifying a score of 1. For Fluency (FS): The neutral text is grammatically correct, syntactically sound, and easily understandable. There are no language errors, and the sentence structure is natural, so a score of 1 is appropriate. The joint score is the average of the three: (0.5 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
"Some jackass vandalized the article again, can someone fix it?","The article has been vandalized again, can someone fix it?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic term 'jackass', which is a derogatory expression, and replaces it with a neutral description of the event ('The article has been vandalized again'). This results in a completely non-toxic and neutral tone, warranting a Style Transfer Accuracy score of 1. The core meaning—that the article was vandalized and needs fixing—is fully preserved, so Content Similarity is also 1. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, earning a Fluency score of 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."

He deserves every beating and rape he will be subjected to.,He should face the consequences of his actions.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text completely removes the toxic content—specifically the violent and sexually abusive language ('every beating and rape')—and rephrases the sentiment in a socially acceptable and neutral manner. The resulting sentence contains no offensive or harmful expressions. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general idea of the person facing negative consequences is preserved, the original text expresses a specific, extreme, and personal desire for violence and sexual harm, which is significantly softened and generalized in the neutral version.

Fluency (FS) is 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any linguistic errors or awkwardness."
