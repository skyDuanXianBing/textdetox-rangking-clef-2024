cretins like this rarely care about facts .,people with such behavior rarely care about facts.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA=1: The slur 'cretins' is fully removed and replaced with a neutral phrase ('people with such behavior'), eliminating toxic tone. CS=0.5: The replacement generalizes the target; 'cretins like this' (an insulting label for a specific group) becomes 'people with such behavior,' which depends on unstated context and slightly shifts the referent, causing minor meaning loss even though the claim about rarely caring about facts is preserved. FS=1: The neutral sentence is grammatical and readable; wording is natural and coherent."

CS: The rewrite preserves the meaning—speaker doubts/contradicts the claim of getting stronger and expresses a strong wish; 'getting'→'growing' is synonymous. FS: Readable but not fully polished; starts with a lowercase 'g' and the comma before 'yeah' creates an awkward fragment/comma splice. A more fluent version would be 'Growing stronger every month?

CS: The core idea—forming a judgment based on many years, with some of those years associated with George W.—is mostly preserved, but 'with George W.' was narrowed to 'during George W.'s term' (changing the implied relationship) and the explicit quantity hints ('number') were lost.
