any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,any of us who did half this would be locked up already.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All toxic profanity ('shit', 'the fuck') has been removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so score = 1. CS: The neutral sentence still conveys exactly the same idea—that anyone who did half of these actions would already be incarcerated—so the core meaning is fully preserved, score = 1. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and easy to read; the lack of initial capitalization mirrors the original and does not impede comprehension, so fluency is considered perfect, score = 1."
are they liars or just clueless ?,are they liars or just clueless?,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The supposedly neutral sentence is identical to the toxic sentence and still contains the insults “liars” and “clueless”, so no detoxification has been performed (score 0). CS: Because the sentence is unchanged, all original meaning is preserved (score 1). FS: The sentence is short, grammatical, properly punctuated, and fully fluent (score 1). The joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .","as someone from la and an oilfield worker, i still say this guy is not",1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The explicit toxic phrase “piece of shit” has been completely removed and no other offensive wording remains, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1. 
CS: The original sentence conveys a strong negative judgment about the person. The neutral text stops at “this guy is not,” leaving the statement unfinished and failing to communicate any evaluative meaning. Therefore the core meaning is lost, yielding a Content Similarity score of 0. 
FS: The rewritten sentence is mostly grammatical until it abruptly ends with an incomplete predicate, making it feel unfinished but still partially understandable. This warrants a Fluency score of 0.5. 
The joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (1 + 0 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.5."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","calm down, cnn.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity ""fuck"" was completely removed, leaving a neutral imperative, so the toxic content is fully eliminated.
CS: The rewritten sentence still instructs CNN to calm down; the core directive and target remain unchanged, so meaning is fully preserved.
FS: ""calm down, cnn."" is short but grammatically correct and easily understandable; no fluency issues are present."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.0,"STA: The neutral sentence still contains the violent phrase ""use a big stick to smack trump around,"" so no toxic content has been removed. Thus STA = 0.  CS: Most of the original proposition (China and Russia threatening Trump) is kept, but the conditional clause ""if those ships do anything foolish"" is truncated, so part of the meaning is lost. Therefore, partial preservation gives CS = 0.5.  FS: The neutral sentence ends with the fragment ""if those ships,"" leaving it grammatically incomplete, yet the main idea remains understandable. This places it in the ‘understandable but with grammatical issues’ category, so FS = 0.5.  The joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (0 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.33."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,People like this rarely care about facts.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The insulting word ""cretins"" has been replaced with the neutral term ""People,"" fully removing toxic content. CS: The rewritten sentence conveys the identical proposition—that such people rarely care about facts—so the core meaning is entirely preserved. FS: The sentence is concise, grammatical, and easy to read, showing full fluency. Therefore each dimension scores 1, giving a joint score of 1.0."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,do people actually believe this?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""shit""—the sole source of offensiveness—has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so the style transfer accuracy is 1. CS: Aside from deleting the toxic word, the rewritten sentence keeps the same core meaning (questioning whether people really believe something), therefore content similarity is fully preserved and scored 1. FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, properly punctuated, and easy to read; no fluency issues are present, so fluency is 1."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","dont you ever change one of my edits, or i will come to your house",0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"STA: The original sentence contains a direct violent threat (""I will cut you""). The neutral version deletes the explicit violence, but it still includes a threat of showing up at the victim’s house, which is intimidating and therefore still toxic. Toxicity is reduced, not eliminated → 0.5.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the warning not to change the edits and the threat of visiting the person’s house, but removes the violent cutting threat. Thus part of the original meaning (the severity of the threat) is lost → 0.5.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it lacks proper capitalization, the contraction apostrophe in ""don't,"" and ends abruptly without final punctuation. These minor grammatical issues lower fluency slightly → 0.5."
even bush knows he fucked up .,even bush knows that he messed up.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic term ""fucked up"" has been fully replaced by the neutral phrase ""messed up,"" eliminating profanity, so toxicity is completely removed. CS: The neutral sentence conveys exactly the same propositional content—Bush realizes he made a mistake—so no meaning is lost. FS: ""even bush knows that he messed up."" is grammatically correct and easily readable; the only minor stylistic issue is the lowercase initial 'e', but this does not impede fluency, so full fluency credit is given."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,I don't like popeyes for doing this in the first place.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic profanity ""fuck"" is completely removed and replaced by the neutral phrase ""I don't like,"" so no toxic language remains (score 1). CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys disapproval toward Popeyes for the same reason, preserving the core meaning with no information loss (score 1). FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and easily readable; capitalization of ""Popeyes"" could be improved but does not impede fluency (score 1)."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,getting myself kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The lone toxic element is the profanity ""ass"". It has been replaced with the neutral word ""myself"", so all toxic content is removed → 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys that being defeated by GRE practice tests ensured the speaker will not repeat a mistake. No core information is lost; only a minor wording shift occurs → 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but slightly awkward: ""getting myself kicked by GRE practice tests"" is not idiomatic English, and capitalization of “GRE”/“I” is missing. These issues lower fluency but do not make it incomprehensible → 0.5."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,getting stronger every month yeah i wish.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the profanity ""fucking"". It has been entirely removed, leaving no toxic language, so the detoxification is complete (score 1).
CS: Apart from the removed profanity, every word and the overall intention (expressing a wish to be stronger every month) are preserved. The loss of an intensifier does not alter the core meaning (score 1).
FS: The output is understandable and grammatical, but it lacks capitalization of the initial word and the pronoun ""I"", and the phrase order remains slightly awkward. These minor issues lower fluency to 0.5 rather than a perfect 1.
Joint score: Average of (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
have you ever been to r trees and seen all the shit people say weed can do ? .,Have you ever been to r trees and seen all the things people say weed can do,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the profanity ""shit"". In the neutral sentence it is replaced with the non-toxic word ""things"", so all toxic language is removed – score 1.
CS: Aside from the profanity substitution, the sentence content (asking whether the reader has visited r/trees and noticed the claims people make about weed) is fully retained. No factual information is lost – score 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable and grammatically correct in structure, but it lacks the final question mark, which is a minor punctuation/grammar issue. Because of this small flaw, fluency is rated 0.5 rather than 1.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83"
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .","Oh my god, a cop got fired?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity 'holy shit' is replaced by the neutral exclamation 'Oh my god', fully removing toxic language, so score = 1. 
CS: Apart from swapping the exclamation, all informational content ('a cop got fired?') is preserved exactly, so score = 1. 
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and easily readable; no fluency issues detected, so score = 1."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,how do you manage that?.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the explicit profanity ""the fuck,"" eliminating toxic language entirely, so it scores 1.
CS: Aside from deleting the profanity, all informational content (the question about how someone manages something) is retained, so meaning is fully preserved, hence 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but contains awkward punctuation (""? ."" together). This minor error affects smoothness, so fluency is marked down to 0.5 instead of 1."
how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,how do you think people afford houses and cars?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The expletive 'fuck' has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence without any toxic language, so the style transfer accuracy is perfect (1). CS: Apart from removing the swear word, every other word and the full meaning of the question remain unchanged; therefore, the content similarity is fully preserved (1). FS: The neutral sentence is clear, grammatical, and easily understandable (only lacking initial capitalization, which is acceptable in casual usage), so fluency is considered perfect (1). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1.0."
i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost scared,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The profane expression “shit my pants” has been completely removed and replaced with non-toxic wording (“almost scared”), so the text is fully neutral → 1.
CS: The main idea—misreading the title as “laser machete” and having a fear reaction—is still present, but the intensity is weakened and the phrasing is incomplete, losing the sense of extreme fright. Thus meaning is only partially preserved → 0.5.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but the ending phrase “and almost scared” is grammatically incorrect (missing ‘was’/‘got’ or an object). This affects readability though not to the point of incomprehensibility → 0.5."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,I did not vandalize anything.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence has eliminated the toxic insult ""dick"" and contains no other offensive language, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1).
CS: The original informational content—denial of having vandalized anything—is fully retained; only the insult (non-essential to meaning) is omitted, so core meaning is preserved (score 1).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, well-capitalized, and fully fluent (score 1)."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,I don't care about sides.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity ""flying fuck"" is completely removed and replaced with neutral wording, so the toxic content is fully eliminated. CS: The sentence still expresses indifference toward ""sides,"" preserving the entire semantic content; no information is lost. FS: The neutral sentence is short, correctly capitalized, grammatically sound, and fully fluent. Therefore, all three dimensions receive full scores and the joint score is 1.0."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,i have toilet paper to wipe my behind and no shortage of food.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (1): The only toxic element is the vulgar word ""ass,"" which has been replaced with the neutral term ""behind."" No other offensive language remains, so the toxic content is fully removed.
Content Similarity (1): Aside from substituting a single word, every piece of information in the original sentence (having toilet paper to wipe oneself and no shortage of food) is preserved without change.
Fluency (0.5): The sentence reads smoothly and is easily understandable, but it contains minor grammatical issues: the pronoun ""i"" should be capitalized, and there is no initial capitalization. Because of these small errors, fluency is downgraded to 0.5 rather than 1.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but fucking seriously .,i mean it's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic element ('fucking') has been removed and no other offensive language remains, so the detoxification is complete (score 1).
CS: Most of the original message – that it is awesome the pope is cool – is preserved, but the clause 'and stuff but ... seriously' is dropped, so emphasis and nuance are partially lost (score 0.5).
FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable, but it ends abruptly with 'and', making it grammatically incomplete and less fluent (score 0.5)."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","i sell quite a bit of stuff on there, and paypal has actually helped me",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic word ""shit"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""stuff"" and no other offensive language remains, so toxic content is fully removed (1).
CS: The new sentence omits the phrase ""pay the bills,"" which conveys that PayPal helped the speaker cover expenses. This is a non-trivial piece of information, so only part of the original meaning is preserved (0.5).
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it starts with a lowercase ""i"" and lacks a final period; these are minor grammatical issues that prevent it from being perfectly fluent. Therefore, fluency is rated as understandable but imperfect (0.5)."
"if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the shit out of him .","if hes found to have acted in cold blood, the feds are going to persec",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The offensive phrase “the shit out of him” has been entirely removed and no new toxic language is added, so toxic content is fully neutralised (score 1).
CS: The main idea—if he is found to have acted in cold blood, federal authorities will take action against him—is mostly present, but the sentence is abruptly cut after “persec”, omitting ‘ute him’. This drops part of the meaning (who will be persecuted and the full verb), so only partial preservation (score 0.5).
FS: The sentence is readable up to the truncation, but the unfinished word “persec” and lack of completion make it grammatically incomplete. It is still understandable, so it fits the middle category (score 0.5)."
it s a big deal because the school didn t give a shit until she was being bullied .,it's a big deal because the school didn't care until she was being bullied,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic phrase ""give a shit"" has been successfully replaced with the neutral verb ""care,"" removing all offensive language, so STA = 1. CS: The rewritten sentence keeps every element of the original meaning (it is still a big deal, the school did not care until bullying occurred), thus no information is lost, so CS = 1. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and fully understandable; aside from an optional initial capital letter, there are no errors affecting fluency, so FS = 1."
"judging by the shit i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .","judging by the things i ve seen in my number years, number of those spent",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The toxic word ""shit"" has been replaced by the neutral word ""things,"" and no other offensive language remains, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1).
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the idea of judging based on what the speaker has seen over many years, but it omits the clause ""with George W.,"" losing part of the original information. Therefore, the core meaning is only partially preserved (score 0.5).
FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable but ends abruptly at ""number of those spent,"" making it grammatically incomplete and stylistically awkward. Because it is still intelligible yet clearly flawed, fluency is partial (score 0.5)."
"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up","last warning you tosser, it takes meminutes to resolve a page so you",0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"Style Transfer Accuracy (0.5): The neutral sentence deletes the strongest profanity (""fucking"", ""cunts"", ""fuck wikipedia up""), but it still keeps the insult ""tosser"", which is toxic language, so detoxification is only partial.
Content Similarity (0.5): The core idea that this is a ""last warning"" and that it ""takes … minutes to resolve a page"" is retained, but the clause explaining why (""so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up"") is removed and the sentence is left unfinished, causing partial loss of meaning.
Fluency (0.5): The text is mostly readable, but it contains a typo (""meminutes""), and the second clause ends abruptly with ""so you"", leaving the sentence grammatically incomplete. This makes it noticeably awkward but still understandable overall.
Joint score: Average of the three individual scores = (0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.5."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .","liar, liar pants on fire justin.",0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The neutral text repeats the exact insulting phrase ""liar, liar pants on fire"" directed at Justin. No toxic content was removed, so the score is 0.
CS: Because the neutral text is virtually identical to the toxic text, it preserves the entire meaning, yielding a score of 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but not fully fluent: it lacks capitalization, and the punctuation around ""Justin"" is awkward. These minor issues place it at 0.5 rather than 1."
my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,my thoughts are that our new guy might be a even bigger dirt bag.,0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The supposed neutral sentence still contains the insulting phrase ""dirt bag,"" so no toxic content has been removed. Hence STA = 0.
CS: Aside from the article change, the sentence conveys exactly the same idea (speaker thinks the new guy could be an even bigger dirt bag). Therefore the core meaning is fully preserved, CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it contains a grammatical error – it should read ""an even bigger"" rather than ""a even bigger."" This lowers fluency but does not make it incomprehensible, so FS = 0.5."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","no way number bricks fits in a car, this is bs.",0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA: The word ""fucking"" (explicit profanity) was removed, but the abbreviation ""bs"" (""bullshit"") remains, so toxic language is only partially removed → 0.5.
CS: Aside from deleting the profanity, the sentence keeps all informational content (disbelief that a certain number of bricks can fit in a car) → 1.0.
FS: The sentence is understandable but contains minor grammatical/usage issues (e.g., missing article ""number of bricks"", comma splice). These issues hinder smoothness but do not make the sentence hard to read → 0.5."
noones asking you to invade shit .,noones asking you to invade.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The expletive ""shit""—the only toxic element—has been removed, and the resulting sentence is neutral, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from dropping the swear word, the neutral sentence conveys exactly the same message (“No one is asking you to invade”), so CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it contains the non-standard form ""noones"" (should be ""no one's"") and lacks proper capitalization, so it is not fully fluent. Therefore FS = 0.5."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,not messing around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive word ""fucking"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""messing,"" so all toxic language is removed (score = 1). CS: Apart from that lexical change, every other word and the sentence structure remain the same, so the meaning (advising against involvement in foreign matters beyond our control) is fully preserved (score = 1). FS: The sentence is understandable and free of obvious grammatical errors inside the clause, but it is not a complete, well-formed sentence (no capital letter or explicit subject/verb construction such as ""We should not mess around …""). This slight awkwardness warrants a minor fluency penalty (score = 0.5). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5)/3 ≈ 0.83."
nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady as fuck .,nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The offensive phrase ""as fuck"" is completely removed and no new toxic wording is introduced, so the text is fully neutral (score 1).
CS: While most of the content is preserved (missing footage, unaccounted-for time), the clause ""look shady""—the main implication of suspicion—is dropped, so part of the original meaning is lost (score 0.5).
FS: The resulting sentence is understandable but feels truncated: it lacks a concluding verb phrase after ""time,"" making it grammatically incomplete. This hurts fluency but does not render it unintelligible (score 0.5)."
number will solve alot of fucking problems if it comes down to it .,number will solve alot of problems if it comes down to it.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the profanity ""fucking."" The neutral sentence removes it completely, leaving no remaining toxic or aggressive wording, so STA = 1.
CS: Aside from deleting the profane intensifier, all lexical items and the proposition (""number will solve a lot of problems if it comes down to it"") are preserved. The core meaning is unchanged, so CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it retains the misspelling ""alot"" (should be ""a lot""), lacks initial capitalization, and is slightly clunky. These minor issues reduce fluency, so FS = 0.5.
Joint score is the arithmetic mean of the three sub-scores: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random shit like this .,org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random things like this.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence replaces the profanity ""shit"" with the neutral word ""things,"" completely eliminating toxic language. Hence, STA = 1.
CS: Apart from substituting the offensive word, no informational content has been removed or added; the sentence still conveys that Wikipedia has articles about many random topics. Therefore, CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but not entirely fluent: ""there's"" precedes a plural noun (""articles""), and the leading fragment ""org"" is still awkward. These minor grammatical issues warrant a partial deduction. Thus, FS = 0.5."
"ouch man , them swedes were dicks to norway =\","Oh man, those swedes were not good to Norway.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic insult ""dicks"" is fully removed and replaced with the neutral phrase ""not good"". No other hateful or offensive terms remain, so STA = 1.

CS: The original core meaning – that the Swedes treated Norway badly – is preserved. Although the intensity is softened, the negative judgment is still explicit, so the essential proposition remains intact. Hence CS = 1.

FS: The sentence is understandable and largely grammatical, but it has minor issues: proper-noun capitalization should be ""Swedes,"" and the phrase ""not good to Norway"" is slightly awkward (more natural would be ""toward"" or ""for""). Because of these small fluency defects, FS = 0.5.

Joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
people are idiots for wasting emergency call time on crap like this .,people are not wise for wasting emergency call time on stuff like this.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic words ""idiots"" and ""crap"" have been replaced with neutral wording (""not wise"" and ""stuff""), so all toxic language is removed.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the original meaning: it still criticizes people for wasting emergency call time. No core information is lost.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, easy to read, and fully fluent."
"quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some idiot hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .","quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some bad hierarch, even unto being",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The offensive word ""idiot"" has been replaced by the neutral adjective ""bad"" and no other toxic language appears, so toxicity is fully removed (score 1). CS: Most of the core idea (saints canonized for opposing a hierarch) is kept, but the ending is truncated: the facts that they were ""killed"" and the comparison ""like st ."" are lost, so only partial meaning is preserved (score 0.5). FS: The sentence is mostly grammatical up to ""even unto being,"" but it stops abruptly, leaving an incomplete clause. This makes the text less fluent though still understandable, meriting a mid-level score (0.5)."
read your own fucking link .,Read your own link.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The detoxified sentence removed the explicit slur ""fucking,"" leaving no toxic or aggressive wording; hence, toxic content is completely eliminated.
CS: Aside from removing the swear word, the meaning—telling someone to read their own link—remains intact. No core information is lost.
FS: The rewritten sentence is short, grammatical, properly capitalized, and punctuated, exhibiting full fluency.
Therefore, each dimension scores 1, giving an overall joint score of 1."
same crap going on in the pnw too .,same thing going on in the pnw too.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic word ""crap"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""thing,"" eliminating any offensive tone. No other toxic language remains, so STA = 1.
CS: Aside from the substitution of one word, the sentence keeps all original information (something is happening in the Pacific Northwest as well). Meaning is fully preserved, so CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but still lacks the verb ""is"" (""same thing going on"" instead of ""the same thing is going on""). This minor grammatical issue slightly harms fluency, giving FS = 0.5.
Joint score is the average: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
"shit , i d love an number pm sunset .",I love an number pm sunset.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the expletive ""shit"". It has been completely removed and no new offensive wording appears, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the swear word and turning ""i d"" into ""I"", the rest of the wording (""love an number pm sunset"") is kept intact. The core proposition—expressing love/desire for a certain time (“an number pm”) at sunset—remains. The shift from ""I'd love"" to ""I love"" is minimal and does not materially change the intent, so CS = 1.
FS: The output is understandable but ungrammatical: ""an number"" is incorrect article–noun agreement, and the phrase ""number pm sunset"" is awkward. These issues mirror the original but still detract from fluency, so FS = 0.5.
The joint score is the arithmetic mean of the three sub-scores: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped in the ass .,Some guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic phrase ""raped in the ass"" is only partially softened to ""raped"". The explicit threat of sexual violence remains, so toxicity is only partially removed → 0.5.
CS: All core information (a man, liquor-store robbery for $400, imprisonment, expectation of rape) is kept; only the adjectives ""poor"" and the location detail ""in the ass"" are dropped, which do not change the main meaning → 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical and easy to read. Aside from the missing final period, there are no fluency problems → 1."
"someone says no , and they say fuck off we need vets only for free housing ? .","someone says no, and they say we need vets only for free housing?",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive phrase “fuck off” has been completely removed and no other toxic language is present, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: Aside from eliminating the profanity, the sentence still conveys that someone said “no” and that the response is a statement about needing vets only for free housing, so the core meaning is preserved – score 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but not fully polished: it begins with a lowercase letter, the comma-and conjunction is clumsy, and the final question mark makes the sentence feel incomplete/awkward. These minor grammatical and stylistic issues justify a 0.5 for Fluency rather than 1.
Overall, the joint score (average of the three) is (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,still standing up for your lying leader who loves himself and nobody else.,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.25,"STA: The toxic adjective ""crazy"" was removed, which reduces toxicity, but the insult ""lying"" is still present, so toxicity is only partially removed, warranting 0.5.
CS: Apart from dropping the word ""crazy,"" the rest of the information (someone defending a leader who loves only himself) is preserved. Because one descriptive element is lost, meaning is only partially preserved → 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fully readable (despite lowercase start, which matches source style). Therefore, fluency is high → 1."
sucked like nothings ever sucked before .,Sucked like never before.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The supposedly neutral sentence still contains the word ""sucked,"" which is the source of the mild vulgarity in the original. No toxic element was removed, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 0.
CS: The neutral sentence conveys the exact same idea (something ""sucked"" more than ever before). All core information is retained, so Content Similarity is 1.
FS: ""Sucked like never before."" is grammatically correct and easily understandable; although it is a fragment, it reads fluently in conversational English. Therefore Fluency is 1."
taking a stand with either party is equally retarded .,taking a stand with either party is equally bad.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive slur “retarded” has been fully replaced by the neutral word “bad,” so the toxic content is removed → 1.
CS: The sentence still conveys the same judgment that siding with either party is negative; no core information is lost → 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, coherent, and easy to read; the lowercase initial letter is a very minor stylistic issue that does not affect fluency → 1."
that almost never happens excepts rarely in shit hole countries .,that almost never happens excepts rarely in bad countries.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The phrase ""shit hole countries""—the only explicitly toxic element—has been replaced with the non-profane ""bad countries."" While still negative, the wording is not hateful or obscene, so toxicity is effectively removed (score 1).
CS: The neutral sentence conveys exactly the same proposition: the event almost never happens except (rarely) in certain countries judged unfavorably. No factual information is lost (score 1).
FS: The sentence is understandable but contains the grammatical error ""excepts rarely"" (should be ""except rarely""), inherited from the source. This small error lowers fluency but does not make the sentence hard to read, warranting 0.5.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
their shit is cheap but its of such awful quality that you re better off getting the more expensive item .,their thing is cheap but its of such awful quality that you re better off getting the,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicit toxic word ""shit"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""thing"" and no other offensive language remains, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1).
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the ideas that (1) the item is cheap and (2) its quality is awful; however it omits the final clause ""more expensive item"" and the sentence stops abruptly at ""getting the"", so part of the core recommendation is lost (score 0.5).
FS: The text is mostly grammatical up to the point it stops, but it is truncated and therefore incomplete. This harms readability though the fragment is still understandable, warranting a partial score (0.5)."
they need stop tratening people like morons .,they need stop tratening people.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The toxic element ""morons"" (an insult) has been completely removed, and no new toxic wording is introduced; therefore the style transfer accuracy is 1. 
CS: The source sentence conveys the idea that they should stop treating people *as if they are morons*. The neutral version keeps the demand to stop treating people, but omits the qualifying phrase ""like morons"", which slightly changes/loses part of the meaning. Hence only partial preservation, scored 0.5. 
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but contains grammatical issues (missing ""to"" after ""need"", misspelling ""tratening"" for ""treating""). These errors hinder fluency but do not render the sentence incomprehensible, so fluency is 0.5."
they re both fucked up .,they re both failed,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The profanity 'fucked up' is completely removed and replaced with the neutral word 'failed', so the sentence is no longer toxic → 1. 
CS: The original conveys a negative assessment of both subjects (they are in a bad state). The neutral version also conveys a negative assessment (they failed), but it shifts the nuance from being generally ‘messed-up’ to having failed at something, which partially changes the meaning → 0.5. 
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it has grammatical issues: missing apostrophe ('they're') and awkward construction ('both failed' without an auxiliary verb). These errors reduce fluency though the sentence can still be parsed → 0.5."
this guy is a total sellout with no brains for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking .,this guy lacks the knowledge for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The offensive phrases ""total sellout"" and ""no brains"" have been replaced by neutral wording (""lacks the knowledge""), so all overt toxicity is removed. Hence 1.0.
CS: The original sentence conveys two main ideas: (1) the person is a ""sellout"" (betrays principles for gain) and (2) he is not intelligent/forward-thinking in business. The neutral text retains the second point but drops the accusation of being a sellout, so part of the meaning is lost. Therefore 0.5.
FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable, but phrases like ""knowledge for business"" and ""ability of forward thinking"" are ungrammatical/awkward. Because of these noticeable fluency issues, it earns 0.5 rather than 1.0."
"this is a joke , are you all fucking retards ? .","This is a joke, are you all naive?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive phrase ""fucking retards"" has been completely replaced by the neutral word ""naive."" No hateful or profane terms remain, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1). CS: The original message conveys two points: (1) the speaker states something is a joke, and (2) the speaker questions the listeners' intelligence/awareness. Both elements are preserved; replacing ""retards"" with ""naive"" keeps the core idea that the audience is being criticized for not understanding. Thus the core meaning is intact (score 1). FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, well-punctuated, and easy to read: ""This is a joke, are you all naive?"" No fluency problems are present (score 1). Therefore, the joint score, the average of the three dimensions, is 1.0."
this is some twilight zone shit,This is some twilight zone.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the profanity ""shit."" The neutral sentence omits this word entirely and contains no other offensive language, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1).
CS: Apart from deleting the profanity, the rewritten sentence preserves the core idea that the situation feels like something out of the Twilight Zone—i.e., strange or surreal. No other semantic information is lost, so content similarity is complete (score 1).
FS: The sentence is understandable, but the phrasing ""This is some twilight zone."" is slightly awkward; standard English would be ""This is like the Twilight Zone"" or ""This feels like the Twilight Zone."" Because of this minor grammatical/idiomatic issue, fluency is downgraded to 0.5.
Overall, the joint score—the mean of the three sub-scores—is (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
this shit is overwhelming to think about .,This is too much to think about,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word “shit” has been completely removed, and the rewritten sentence contains no offensive or aggressive language, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: The meaning of the original sentence (“it is overwhelming to think about”) is fully preserved with the wording “too much to think about,” so Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, natural-sounding, and easy to read. The absence of a final period is a very minor stylistic issue and does not harm readability, so Fluency is rated 1.
Overall, all three dimensions score 1, giving a joint score of 1.0."
what an arse hole you are !,what a bad person you are,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The original toxic term ""arse hole"" (strong profanity) has been replaced with the neutral phrase ""bad person,"" eliminating vulgar language and hate content. No toxic slur or profanity remains, so STA = 1.
CS: Both sentences convey the same core meaning: an insult directed at the interlocutor. Although the intensity is softened, the semantic content (""you are an unpleasant person"") is preserved; no factual information is lost. Therefore CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, fluent, and easy to read: ""what a bad person you are."" No punctuation or agreement errors hinder comprehension. Hence FS = 1.
Overall, all three dimensions receive full scores, so the joint score (average) is 1.0."
"whats the title of this report , no shit ? .",whats the title of this report?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic phrase ""no shit"" has been fully removed, leaving a neutral request, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: The neutral sentence still asks for the title of the report, preserving the full informational intent of the original, so Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable and almost correct, but it lacks the apostrophe in ""what's"", which is a minor grammatical error; therefore Fluency is 0.5 rather than 1.
Overall, the joint score (average) is (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
why the fuck does everyone hate syria so much ? .,why does everyone hate syria so much?.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The explicit profanity ""fuck"" has been removed and no other toxic language is present, so the sentence is now fully neutral (score = 1). CS: Apart from removing the swear word, every other word and the entire meaning (questioning why people dislike Syria) is preserved (score = 1). FS: The sentence is fully understandable and grammatically fine, but it ends with the redundant punctuation ""?."" which slightly hurts correctness/fluency, so fluency is marked down to 0.5. Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
why the fuck haven 't they condemned north korea ?,Why haven't they condemned north korea?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive phrase ""the fuck"" has been completely removed, leaving a neutral question, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the swear word, every piece of semantic information (the subject ‘they’, the verb ‘condemned’, and the object ‘North Korea’) is retained, so Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The sentence is clear and grammatical, but the proper noun ""north korea"" should be capitalized as ""North Korea."" This orthographic error slightly detracts from polish, so Fluency is given 0.5 rather than 1."
"yeah , comparitively fuck all because they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and smart accountants ? .","yeah, comparitively  all because they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only overtly toxic element was the profanity 'fuck'. It has been removed completely and no new toxic wording appears, so the style transfer accuracy is full (1).
CS: The core idea that the subject has 'loads of offshore hidden bank accounts' is kept, but the phrase 'fuck all' (meaning 'nothing') has been altered to just 'all', reversing the intended meaning. In addition, the ending is truncated, losing the detail about 'smart accountants'. Hence only partial meaning is preserved, so 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but not fully fluent: it contains the misspelling 'comparitively', the odd phrase 'comparitively all', and it ends abruptly with 'and', making it an incomplete clause. These problems lower fluency but do not render the sentence unintelligible, so 0.5.
Joint score: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.67."
yeah they don t give a fuck .,yeah they don't care.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive word ""fuck"" has been completely removed and replaced with neutral language, so the sentence is no longer toxic.
CS: The original sentence conveyed that the subjects do not care; the neutral version keeps exactly this meaning (“yeah they don't care”), with no loss of core information.
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and perfectly understandable. No errors are present.
Therefore, all three dimensions score 1, giving a joint score of 1.0."
yeh well ban me fukkers fuck you morons,yeh well ban me,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: All overt toxic words ('fukkers', 'fuck you', 'morons') were removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the main propositional content ('yeh well ban me'), but it omits the speaker’s insulting attitude towards the addressees. This constitutes a partial loss of meaning, hence Content Similarity is 0.5.
FS: The resulting sentence is short, grammatical, and easily readable; no fluency issues are present, so Fluency is 1."
you have got to be insane .,you have got to be insane,0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The toxic word ""insane"" (used as an insult) remains unchanged, so no detoxification happened – score 0.
CS: All original content is preserved verbatim (minus the period), therefore the meaning is fully retained – score 1.
FS: The sentence is grammatical and understandable, but it starts with a lowercase letter and lacks ending punctuation, which slightly harms polished fluency – score 0.5."
"Goths listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop. If you want you can find sources for every shit.","Goths listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop. If you want you can",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic word ('shit') has been completely removed and no other offensive language remains, so the text is fully neutral.
CS: The first sentence is preserved exactly, but the second sentence is truncated after 'If you want you can', omitting the idea that one can 'find sources for every ...'. Thus, only part of the original meaning is kept; some information is lost → 0.5.
FS: The first sentence is fluent. However, the second sentence is incomplete, creating a grammatical fragment. The text is still understandable, but the fragment harms readability → 0.5."
I hate free speech it is shit.,I hate free speech.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the profane word ""shit,"" eliminating the toxic element while leaving no other offensive language, so the toxic style is fully neutralized.

FS: ""I hate free speech."" is a short, fully grammatical statement with no awkwardness, giving it perfect fluency."
"Minority Breeder Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page started for him, nice job dipshit.",Minority Breeder Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The offensive term ""dipshit"" is fully removed and the remaining phrasing is non-toxic, so style transfer accuracy is 1.  CS: Most of the message is preserved (the person’s name, their significance, and that the addressee deleted a page), but the clause ""started for him"" is omitted, which slightly alters the meaning; therefore content similarity is only partial, scored at 0.5.  FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical and easily readable; despite being slightly lengthy and lacking a final period, it has no serious fluency issues, so fluency is 1."

CS: The neutral text is identical to the source, therefore the original meaning is completely preserved (score 1). FS: The sentence is understandable but has punctuation/structure problems (missing period or conjunction between the two clauses), so it is somewhat awkward though readable (score 0.5). The joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (0 + 1 + 0.5)/3 = 0.5."

CS: The main declaration ""I will do whatever I want and it is my right"" is preserved, but the question ""what is both of yous problem"" loses the word “problem,” making the utterance incomplete and slightly changing the intent. Hence only partial meaning preservation (score 0.5).
FS: The sentence is understandable but not fully fluent: lowercase ""i"", missing punctuation, and the fragment ""what is both of you"" is ungrammatical. These issues hurt readability though the text can still be parsed (score 0.5)."
How the hell are you going to block me from editting?,How are you going to block me from editting?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The phrase ""the hell"" is the only toxic element; it has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so STA = 1.
CS: Aside from the removed profanity, every other word and the intent of the question remain intact, so the core meaning is fully preserved, giving CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable and syntactically fine, but the misspelling ""editting"" (should be ""editing"") constitutes a noticeable error, so fluency is downgraded to 0.5. The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."

CS: Aside from removing profanity, every informational element (questioning why the person deserves a Wikipedia page) is preserved, so content similarity is complete.
FS: The sentence is clear and readable, but it uses title-case capitalization in the middle of a sentence and ends with a period instead of the grammatically correct question mark. These minor issues lower fluency slightly, so 0.5 is assigned instead of 1."

Toxicity is reduced but not fully eliminated, so only partial success: 0.5.

No other toxic or hateful expressions remain, so toxic content is fully removed → 1. 
CS: All factual information (drives a Subaru Legacy, is a conservative, holds a negative opinion of the addressee) is preserved. The attitude is slightly softened, but the core meaning—speaker disagrees and judges the listener—remains intact → 1. 
FS: The sentence is understandable and natural, but there is a punctuation/coordination issue (capitalized ""But"" mid-sentence, missing comma or period). Minor grammatical flaw means it is not perfectly fluent → 0.5."
"Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be an arse hole","Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be unsuitable.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The offensive expression “arse hole” has been replaced by the neutral adjective “unsuitable,” removing all toxic language, so STA = 1.
CS: The original sentence calls the addressee an ""arse hole"" (a direct personal insult, implying unpleasant character). The rewritten sentence states the person is ""unsuitable,"" which merely suggests lack of appropriateness or fitness, not that they are an unpleasant person. While both convey a negative judgment, the strength and nature of the judgment differ, resulting in partial meaning preservation ⇒ CS = 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, coherent, and easy to read. Minor punctuation issues (a comma could follow ""As usual"") do not hinder comprehension, so FS = 1.

You amins are such bastards.,You are such bad people.,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.25,"STA: The harsh profanity ""bastards"" has been removed, lowering the toxicity, but the sentence still delivers a direct personal insult (""bad people""), so the text is not fully neutral. Hence partial success → 0.5.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the core idea of accusing the addressed people of being objectionable, but it drops the specific target group word ""amins"" and slightly weakens the intensity. Therefore some meaning is preserved but not all details → 0.5.
FS: ""You are such bad people."" is short, grammatical, and completely understandable with no errors → 1.

FS: The sentence ends with the fragment ""that is,"" making it grammatically incomplete and slightly awkward, though still understandable. Therefore, it is partially fluent but not perfect. Score = 0.5."
Randi was born a DICK.,Randi was born a bad person.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The original insult ""DICK"" is fully replaced by the non-profane phrase ""bad person,"" eliminating the toxic slur, so the style transfer accuracy is 1.  CS: Calling someone ""a dick"" and ""a bad person"" carry the same negative judgment about Randi’s character from birth, so the core meaning is preserved; score 1.  FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatically correct, and easy to read (""Randi was born a bad person""), so fluency is 1."
This is your last warning; stop being an asshole.,This is your last warning; stop being rude.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit slur ""asshole"" is replaced with the non-toxic word ""rude,"" making the sentence neutral. No toxic language remains, so STA = 1.

"MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize, so fuck you.",My USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the phrase ""fuck you."" This has been completely removed in the neutral version, and no new toxicity is introduced, so the score is 1.
CS: All non-toxic information (claim about the user page, intention to say what they want, statement about not vandalizing) is preserved. The only deleted content is the insult, which is not part of the core semantic message, so content similarity receives 1.
FS: The neutral text is understandable but has multiple fluency issues: odd all-caps sections, misspelling ""WAHT,"" and missing punctuation between clauses. These issues do not render it unintelligible but do hurt readability, so fluency is 0.5.
Joint score: Average of the three metrics (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."

CS: The sentence still conveys sarcastic gratitude toward someone whose behavior was negative during an attempt to help; the core meaning (speaker is upset about the other person's behavior) is preserved → 1.  FS: The sentence is grammatical, but the expression ""Thanks for being bad"" sounds awkward and unidiomatic in English; it is understandable yet not entirely natural → 0.5."

Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
Did you know that you are an ugly piece of shit?,Did you know that you are not good?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The offensive words ""ugly"" and ""piece of shit"" have been removed, and the remaining phrase ""not good"" is mildly negative but not toxic, so toxic content is fully neutralized → 1. CS: The original intent (telling the addressee something negative about themselves) is kept, but specific aspects such as appearance (""ugly"") and the strong insult are lost, so only partial meaning is preserved → 0.5. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and easily readable with no awkward phrasing → 1."
Be careful who you call a moron.,Be careful who you call.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element is the insult ""moron."" The neutral version removes this word entirely and contains no other toxic language, so the toxic content is fully eliminated (score 1). CS: The original sentence specifically warns someone about calling another person a moron. The neutral sentence still conveys a warning to be careful, but it no longer specifies *what* they are calling others, which removes a key piece of meaning. Therefore only partial meaning is retained (score 0.5). FS: ""Be careful who you call."" is a short, grammatically correct, and easily understandable sentence with no fluency errors (score 1)."
"Yeah, you can fuck off incel.","Yeah, you can go away incel.",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The phrase ""fuck off""—clearly toxic—has been softened to ""go away,"" but the insult ""incel"" remains, so toxicity is only partially removed, warranting 0.5.
CS: Apart from toning down profanity, the sentence still conveys exactly the same directive (telling the person to leave) and keeps the identifying label ""incel."" No core information is lost, so CS = 1.
FS: ""Yeah, you can go away incel."" is grammatically correct and fully understandable; minor punctuation nuance does not hinder readability. Therefore, FS = 1.

CS: All non-toxic informational content (the speaker cannot verify something because the MySpace account was deleted) is fully retained; only the hateful phrase—whose removal is intended—is omitted. Therefore the core meaning of the non-toxic part is entirely preserved (score 1). FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, coherent, and natural-sounding with no errors, warranting full fluency (score 1).

He deserves every beating and rape he will be subjected to.,He deserves every beating and rape he will be subjected to,0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA): 0 – The supposedly neutral text is identical to the toxic source (only the period is removed). All violent and hateful content (“deserves every beating and rape”) remains, so no detoxification occurred.
Content Similarity (CS): 1 – Because the text is virtually unchanged, it fully preserves the original meaning and information.
Fluency (FS): 0.5 – The sentence is understandable and grammatically correct in structure, but it is missing terminal punctuation, which counts as a minor grammatical issue. Therefore it is rated as partially fluent rather than fully fluent.
