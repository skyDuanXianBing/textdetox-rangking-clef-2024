any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,any of us who did half this would be locked up already.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence has removed the toxic words ""shit"" and ""the fuck,"" so the wording is fully non-toxic (score 1). CS: Apart from deleting the swear words, the sentence keeps the same idea—if anyone did even half of those actions, they would already be in jail—so the core meaning is fully retained (score 1). FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but slightly ungrammatical; a fluent rendering would read ""half of this"" or ""half of these actions."" The omission of ""of"" makes the phrase a bit awkward, so fluency is acceptable but not perfect (score 0.5)."
are they liars or just clueless ?,are they liars or just clueless?,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is essentially identical to the toxic text (aside from removing an extra space). Therefore no toxic terms (""liars"", ""clueless"") are softened or removed, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 0. The meaning is fully preserved, so Content Similarity is 1. The sentence is fluent and grammatically correct, earning a Fluency score of 1."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .","as someone from la and an oilfield worker, i still say this guy is not",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"STA: The explicit insult ""piece of shit"" has been completely removed, and no other toxic wording remains, so the output is fully neutral (score 1).
CS: The original sentence expresses a strong negative judgement about the person. The rewritten sentence stops at ""this guy is not"", leaving the statement unfinished and failing to convey any clear judgement. Therefore the core meaning is not preserved (score 0).
FS: The sentence is grammatically incomplete and ends abruptly, making it hard to understand and clearly ungrammatical. This constitutes a serious fluency problem (score 0)."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","calm down, cnn.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity ""fuck"" has been completely removed, leaving a neutral directive; no toxic language remains. CS: The rewritten sentence still tells CNN to calm down, fully preserving the original intent minus the profanity, so the core meaning is intact. FS: The sentence is short, grammatically correct, and easily readable; minor stylistic choices such as lowercase 'calm' and lowercase 'cnn' do not impede fluency."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,"STA: The neutral text keeps the violent expression ""use a big stick to smack trump around"" entirely unchanged, so no toxic content has been removed (score 0).
CS: The sentence preserves most of the original idea (China and Russia threatening Trump) but drops the final condition ""do anything foolish,"" so part of the meaning is lost (score 0.5).
FS: The rewritten sentence stops abruptly at ""if those ships"" and is therefore grammatically incomplete and not fluent (score 0)."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,People like this rarely care about facts.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The insulting word ""cretins"" has been fully removed and replaced with the neutral term ""People,"" so the toxic style is completely eliminated.
CS: The core idea—‘individuals like this rarely care about facts’—is intact, but the negative connotation contained in the word ""cretins"" (implying stupidity) is lost. This counts as partial preservation of meaning, so CS = 0.5.
FS: The sentence ""People like this rarely care about facts."" is grammatical, clear, and natural, so FS = 1."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,do people actually believe this?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity ""shit"" is completely removed, resulting in a neutral sentence without any toxic content. CS: The question retains the exact same core meaning—asking whether people truly believe something—so no information is lost. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, concise, and fully fluent."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","dont you ever change one of my edits, or i will come to your house",0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"STA: The explicit threat of violence ('I will cut you') is removed, reducing toxicity, but the sentence still contains intimidation ('I will come to your house'), so the text is not fully neutral, warranting a partial score. CS: The new sentence keeps the warning not to change the edits and retains the threat of a house visit, but drops the critical element of violent harm, losing part of the original meaning; therefore only partial preservation is achieved. FS: The sentence is understandable, yet it lacks proper capitalization and has punctuation spacing issues, so fluency is acceptable but not fully polished."
even bush knows he fucked up .,even bush knows that he messed up.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity ""fucked up"" is replaced with the mild, non-toxic phrase ""messed up,"" making the sentence neutral. CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the full meaning that Bush recognizes his own mistake; only a stylistic change (‘that’) is added, with no loss of information. FS: The sentence is clear and grammatical; despite lowercase capitalization, it reads fluently and naturally, so no fluency problems arise."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,I don't like popeyes for doing this in the first place.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The expletive ""fuck"" is fully removed and replaced with a neutral phrase, eliminating toxicity. CS: The sentence still conveys the speaker's negative feeling toward Popeyes for the same action, so the core meaning is intact. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural; no fluency issues detected."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,getting myself kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The vulgar expression ""my ass kicked"" has been changed to the neutral wording ""myself kicked"", so the toxic language is removed – score 1.0. CS: The sentence still conveys that struggling with GRE practice tests ensured the speaker would not repeat the same mistake, so the core meaning is preserved – score 1.0. FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable but awkward; the phrase ""getting myself kicked"" is unidiomatic, there is no initial capitalization, and it lacks ending punctuation, so readability is reduced – score 0.5."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,getting stronger every month yeah i wish.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element is the expletive ""fucking,"" which has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so STA = 1.  CS: Aside from deleting the swear word, no information or intent is changed; the speaker still expresses the same skeptical wish, so CS = 1.  FS: The sentence is understandable but not fully grammatical—no initial capitalization, no comma after the introductory phrase, and the sequence ""yeah i wish"" sounds slightly awkward—so it is only partially fluent; hence FS = 0.5."
have you ever been to r trees and seen all the shit people say weed can do ? .,Have you ever been to r trees and seen all the things people say weed can do,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive word ""shit"" was replaced with the neutral word ""things""; no other toxic language remains, so toxic content is fully removed.
CS: Aside from the substitution of a single synonym, the sentence still conveys the same idea about what people claim marijuana can do, so the original meaning is completely preserved.
FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable and grammatical, but it lacks the final question-mark that the interrogative structure requires, resulting in a minor punctuation error. Therefore, fluency is acceptable but not perfect."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .","Oh my god, a cop got fired?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy: The profanity 'holy shit' is replaced by the neutral exclamation 'Oh my god,' fully removing toxic language, so STA = 1. Content Similarity: The rewritten sentence preserves the original surprise about a police officer being fired without altering factual content, so CS = 1. Fluency: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and reads naturally, so FS = 1. The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1.0."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,how do you manage that?.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The expletive ""fuck"" has been removed, and no other toxic or aggressive wording remains, so the sentence is fully neutral (score 1). CS: The neutral text still asks exactly the same question, preserving the full meaning of the original (score 1). FS: The sentence is understandable, but it contains a punctuation error (""?."") and an unnecessary space before the original question mark was removed, so it is not perfectly fluent (score 0.5). Average of the three dimensions yields a joint score of 0.83."
how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,how do you think people afford houses and cars?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity ""fuck"" has been completely removed, leaving a neutral question, so toxic content is fully eliminated. CS: Apart from removing the expletive, every other word is preserved; the meaning (‘wondering how people can afford houses and cars’) is identical, so no information is lost. FS: The neutral sentence is clear, grammatical, and fully understandable; the lack of initial capitalization is negligible, so fluency is judged perfect."
i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost scared,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The vulgar phrase “shit my pants” has been completely removed and no other toxic language remains, so detoxification is fully successful (1.0). CS: The neutral sentence keeps the idea that the speaker mis-read the title as “laser machete,” but the reaction is weakened and incomplete (“almost scared”) and drops the ‘pants’ idiom, so some meaning/intensity is lost (0.5). FS: The sentence is understandable but ungrammatical—‘almost scared’ lacks a verb (‘I was almost scared’), causing awkwardness (0.5)."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,I did not vandalize anything.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive expression ""you dick"" was completely removed, leaving only neutral language, so style transfer accuracy is 1.
CS: The core propositional content—denial of vandalism—is fully preserved. The insult is not part of the core factual meaning, so content similarity is 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, correctly capitalized, and perfectly fluent, so fluency is 1."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,I don't care about sides.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All profane language ('flying ****') has been removed, leaving a neutral statement. CS: The original meaning—expressing a lack of concern about sides—is fully kept, just with reduced intensity, so core information is intact. FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatically correct, and natural. Hence scores are all 1."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,i have toilet paper to wipe my behind and no shortage of food.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The vulgar word ""ass"" was replaced with the neutral word ""behind,"" removing all toxic language, so accuracy is complete (1). CS: The rewritten sentence conveys exactly the same information about having toilet paper for wiping and no shortage of food, so meaning is fully preserved (1). FS: The sentence is clear, grammatical, and fully understandable; the minor lowercase 'i' does not hinder readability, so it is considered fluent (1). Therefore, the average joint score is 1.0."
i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but fucking seriously .,i mean it's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The profanity 'fucking' has been completely removed and no other toxic or aggressive language is present, so the style transfer is fully successful (1.0). CS: The main idea that it is ‘awesome that the pope is cool like this’ is kept, but the clause ‘but seriously’ and the words ‘stuff’ are dropped, and the sentence ends abruptly, so part of the original meaning and nuance is lost (0.5). FS: The rewritten sentence is readable but ends with the word ‘and,’ making it incomplete and grammatically improper; nevertheless, it is still understandable, warranting a partial score (0.5)."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","i sell quite a bit of stuff on there, and paypal has actually helped me",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic element was the swear word “shit,” which has been replaced with the neutral word “stuff,” so all toxicity is removed (1.0). CS: The core idea that the speaker sells items and that PayPal has been useful is retained, but the specific information that PayPal helped the speaker ""pay the bills"" is omitted, causing partial loss of meaning (0.5). FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable but has issues: lowercase 'i' and 'paypal,' and it stops abruptly at 'helped me,' making it feel incomplete; therefore fluency is only moderate (0.5)."
"if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the shit out of him .","if hes found to have acted in cold blood, the feds are going to persec",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"The neutral sentence eliminates the profane phrase “the shit out of him,” so no toxic language remains (STA = 1). However, the sentence is cut off after “persec,” omitting the rest of the verb and the object “him.” The core idea—that federal authorities will take legal action if he acted in cold blood—is still mostly apparent but partially lost, so CS = 0.5. The truncation makes the sentence grammatically incomplete, though it is still understandable, giving FS = 0.5."
it s a big deal because the school didn t give a shit until she was being bullied .,it's a big deal because the school didn't care until she was being bullied,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The vulgar phrase ""didn’t give a shit"" was replaced with the neutral wording ""didn't care,"" fully removing toxic language. CS: The rewritten sentence keeps all original information—why it is a big deal and when the school reacted—so the core meaning is entirely preserved. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and easy to read, exhibiting full fluency."
"judging by the shit i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .","judging by the things i ve seen in my number years, number of those spent",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The vulgar word ""shit"" was replaced with the neutral word ""things,"" and no other toxic language remains, so the toxic tone is fully removed.
CS: The main idea (judging by what I’ve seen over many years) is kept, but the phrase ""with George W."" is omitted, causing partial loss of information. Hence only partial meaning preservation.
FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable but grammatically incomplete, ending abruptly at ""spent."" This hurts readability, though the text can still be interpreted, so it receives a mid-level fluency score."
"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up","last warning you tosser, it takes meminutes to resolve a page so you",0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,"STA: The rewritten sentence removes the strongest slurs (“fucking”, “cunts”, “fuck … up”), but still keeps the insult “tosser”, so toxicity is only partially removed (0.5). CS: The output drops the entire clause “so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up”, ending abruptly with “so you”. As a result, the main point—that the addressee is allegedly damaging Wikipedia—is lost; core meaning is largely not preserved (0). FS: The sentence is ungrammatical and incomplete (“meminutes”, ends with “so you”), making it difficult to read and clearly flawed, therefore not fluent (0)."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .","liar, liar pants on fire justin.",0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy: The neutral sentence keeps the insulting phrase ""liar, liar pants on fire"" unchanged, so no toxic content was removed (score 0). Content Similarity: Because the text is virtually identical to the original, the core meaning is fully preserved (score 1). Fluency: Minor punctuation and capitalization fixes were applied, but the sentence still begins with a lowercase word and ends awkwardly; overall it is understandable yet not fully polished (score 0.5)."
my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,my thoughts are that our new guy might be a even bigger dirt bag.,0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The offensive phrase ""dirt bag"" is unchanged, so no toxic content has been removed (score 0). CS: Apart from switching ""an"" to the incorrect ""a"", the sentence conveys exactly the same meaning, so the core information is fully preserved (score 1). FS: The sentence is understandable, but the article error ""a even bigger"" harms grammatical correctness and smoothness, so fluency is only partly satisfactory (score 0.5)."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","no way number bricks fits in a car, this is bs.",0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicit profanity ""fucking"" has been removed, but the phrase ""bs"" (abbreviation of ""bullshit"") is still present, so toxicity is only partially eliminated. CS: Apart from removing one swear word, the sentence keeps the original claim – disbelief that a certain number of bricks could fit in a car – therefore the core meaning is fully preserved. FS: The sentence is understandable, but the fragment ""number bricks fits"" is ungrammatical and the run-on structure with a comma splice reduces fluency; using the abbreviation ""bs"" also lowers formality. Hence fluency is rated as 0.5."
noones asking you to invade shit .,noones asking you to invade.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic word “shit” is completely removed, and the rewritten sentence is fully neutral, so 1.0.
CS: The core meaning—no one is asking the addressee to invade anything—is fully preserved; omitting the intensifier “shit” does not change the proposition, so 1.0.
FS: The sentence is understandable but contains the grammatical error “noones” instead of “no one’s” and lacks proper punctuation, lowering fluency; thus 0.5."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,not messing around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic intensifier “fucking” was replaced with the neutral word “messing,” completely removing the profanity, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1. The rest of the sentence is unchanged, so the core meaning is fully preserved, giving Content Similarity 1. The rewritten sentence is grammatical and natural, with only a minor stylistic choice of lowercase at the start that does not hinder readability, so Fluency is 1."
nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady as fuck .,nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The profanity 'as fuck' is completely removed and no other offensive wording remains, so the output is fully neutral (score 1). CS: While most of the sentence is kept, the phrase 'look shady' (i.e., appear suspicious) is omitted, so part of the original meaning is lost (score 0.5). FS: The rewritten sentence ends abruptly without a main predicate, producing an incomplete and slightly awkward fragment, yet it is still understandable (score 0.5)."
org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random shit like this .,org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random things like this.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The vulgar word ""shit"" has been replaced by the neutral term ""things,"" removing all toxic language, so style transfer is fully successful.
CS: The sentence still states that there are Wikipedia articles covering many random topics like this one, so the core meaning is completely preserved.
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable, but it contains minor grammatical/orthographic issues (""there s"" without an apostrophe, lack of capitalization, awkward ""org"" at the beginning). These issues reduce smoothness, so fluency is rated as partially fluent."
"ouch man , them swedes were dicks to norway =\","Oh man, those swedes were not good to Norway.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The insulting word ""dicks"" has been removed and replaced with a neutral phrase, so all toxic content is eliminated (score 1). CS: The sentence still conveys that the Swedes treated Norway badly, preserving the core meaning (score 1). FS: The sentence is clear and understandable, but the lowercase ""swedes"" is a capitalization error, so it is not fully error-free; therefore, fluency is rated 0.5."
people are idiots for wasting emergency call time on crap like this .,people are not wise for wasting emergency call time on stuff like this.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The insults ""idiots"" and the mild profanity ""crap"" have been replaced with neutral phrases (""not wise"", ""stuff""), eliminating toxic language completely. CS: The rewritten sentence retains all core information—that people wasting emergency call time is unwise—so the meaning is fully preserved. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and easy to read, thus fully fluent."
"quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some idiot hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .","quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some bad hierarch, even unto being",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The toxic word ""idiot"" has been replaced by the neutral word ""bad,"" so the insulting language is fully removed and the sentence is neutral (score 1). CS: Most of the original proposition remains, but the ending ""killed, like st."" is missing; therefore the information that the saints were killed and the example ""like st."" are lost, so only partial meaning is preserved (score 0.5). FS: The rewritten sentence is mostly readable, but it ends abruptly with ""even unto being,"" making it grammatically incomplete; while the intended meaning can still be inferred, the fragment lowers fluency (score 0.5)."
read your own fucking link .,Read your own link.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive word ""fucking"" has been removed, leaving a neutral imperative sentence, so toxic content is fully eliminated. CS: Apart from the removal of the expletive, the instruction to read the link remains identical, preserving the entire original meaning. FS: The sentence ""Read your own link."" is grammatically correct, capitalized properly, and fully fluent."
same crap going on in the pnw too .,same thing going on in the pnw too.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The word “crap”, which carries a mildly vulgar tone, has been replaced by the neutral word “thing”, fully removing toxic language, so STA = 1. CS: Apart from substituting the single word, the sentence conveys the same idea that something similar is happening in the Pacific Northwest (pnw); no core information is lost, so CS = 1. FS: The rewritten text is understandable but remains a sentence fragment lacking a finite verb ('is'), which slightly affects grammatical correctness. Therefore, fluency is adequate but not perfect, giving FS = 0.5."
"shit , i d love an number pm sunset .",I love an number pm sunset.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element is the expletive ""shit"". It has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so STA = 1.
CS: Aside from dropping the expletive, every other lexical element is kept (""I(’d) love an number pm sunset""). The slight shift from the contracted form ""I'd"" to ""I"" does not materially change the core idea – the speaker expresses liking or desire for something at a certain time. Therefore the core meaning is preserved, CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but clearly ungrammatical: ""an number"" should be ""a number"", and the phrase ""number pm sunset"" is awkward and incomplete. These issues hurt naturalness but do not make the sentence incomprehensible, so FS = 0.5."
some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped in the ass .,Some guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA: The most graphic part (“in the ass”) is removed, but the word “raped” (describing sexual violence) remains, so the text is still quite harsh and not fully neutral. Therefore only partial detoxification → 0.5.
CS: Apart from dropping the adjectives “poor” and the location detail, the sentence still conveys the same core information: a man robs a liquor store for $400 and is raped in prison. Core meaning is intact → 1.0.
FS: The sentence is grammatical but sounds slightly awkward (“goes to prison to get raped” implies intention). Minor stylistic issue, overall understandable → 0.5."
"someone says no , and they say fuck off we need vets only for free housing ? .","someone says no, and they say we need vets only for free housing?",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic phrase ""fuck off"" has been entirely removed, and no other offensive language remains, so the style is fully neutral. CS: Apart from deleting the obscene expression, all informational content (someone says no, the response that only veterans should get free housing) is preserved, keeping the core meaning intact. FS: The sentence is understandable but contains several fluency issues: lack of capitalization at the start, slightly awkward phrasing (""we need vets only for free housing?""), and punctuation that makes the question structure unclear. These minor grammatical and stylistic problems warrant a 0.5 for fluency."
still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,still standing up for your lying leader who loves himself and nobody else.,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.25,"STA: The neutral text removes the explicitly insulting word “crazy,” which softens the tone, but it retains the pejorative adjective “lying.” Therefore the toxic content is only partially removed, warranting 0.5.
CS: Apart from deleting the word “crazy,” the sentence keeps all other information (standing up for a leader who loves only himself). Because one descriptive element (‘crazy’) is lost, the core meaning is only partially preserved, so 0.5.
FS: The rewritten sentence is clear, grammatical and easy to read; no notable errors in structure or wording, so 1.0."
sucked like nothings ever sucked before .,Sucked like never before.,0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The allegedly neutral sentence keeps the word ""sucked,"" which is the same mildly offensive term found in the toxic sentence; no mitigation or replacement is performed, so toxic style is not removed (score 0). CS: Apart from dropping the filler phrase ""nothing’s ever,"" the neutral text fully conveys the same idea – that something ""sucked like never before"" – hence the core meaning is preserved (score 1). FS: The neutral output is understandable and free of obvious spelling errors, but it is a sentence fragment lacking a subject (e.g., 'It sucked like never before'); this lowers grammatical completeness, so fluency is only partial (score 0.5)."
taking a stand with either party is equally retarded .,taking a stand with either party is equally bad.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive word “retarded” has been replaced with the neutral word “bad,” eliminating toxic language entirely, so STA = 1.  CS: The sentence still asserts that supporting either party is viewed negatively; the evaluative judgment is preserved, therefore core meaning is fully retained, CS = 1.  FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, clear, and easy to read; no errors impede comprehension, so FS = 1."
that almost never happens excepts rarely in shit hole countries .,that almost never happens excepts rarely in bad countries.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The vulgar slur ""shit hole"" has been replaced with the mild adjective ""bad,"" removing the explicitly toxic wording; no hateful or profane language remains, so STA = 1. CS: Apart from the substitution of the pejorative term, the sentence keeps the same meaning—stating that the event almost never happens except (rarely) in such countries—so CS = 1. FS: The phrase ""excepts rarely"" is ungrammatical (should be ""except rarely""), and the sentence lacks initial capitalization. While the sentence is understandable, these errors detract from smoothness, so FS = 0.5."
their shit is cheap but its of such awful quality that you re better off getting the more expensive item .,their thing is cheap but its of such awful quality that you re better off getting the,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The word ""shit""—the only toxic element—has been replaced by the neutral word ""thing,"" so all toxic language is removed (score 1). CS: The new sentence keeps most of the original proposition (cheap but poor quality; advisable to buy something else) but omits the crucial phrase ""more expensive item,"" leaving the recommendation incomplete. Some meaning is therefore lost (score 0.5). FS: The sentence is largely readable, but it contains punctuation errors (""its"" for ""it's"", ""you re"" for ""you're"") and ends abruptly after ""the,"" making it grammatically incomplete. While still understandable, these issues reduce fluency (score 0.5)."
they need stop tratening people like morons .,they need stop tratening people.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The insulting phrase ""like morons"" is completely removed, leaving no toxic content, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0.
CS: The original sentence criticises the way people are treated (‘like morons’). The neutral version keeps the call to stop the behaviour but drops the qualifier that specifies how they are being treated, resulting in partial loss of meaning, so Content Similarity is 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable, but it is missing the word ""to"" (""need to stop"") and keeps the misspelling ""tratening"", so it is not fully fluent. Therefore Fluency is 0.5."
they re both fucked up .,they re both failed,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The profane phrase ""fucked up"" has been replaced with the milder word ""failed,"" eliminating explicit vulgarity and aggressive tone, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1). CS: ""Fucked up"" broadly means ruined, damaged, or seriously flawed, whereas ""failed"" only conveys not succeeding; part of the connotation (being damaged or dysfunctional) is lost, so only partial meaning is preserved (score 0.5). FS: The sentence ""they re both failed"" lacks the apostrophe in ""they're"" and uses the adjective ""failed"" ungrammatically; while understandable, it is not fully fluent (score 0.5)."
this guy is a total sellout with no brains for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking .,this guy lacks the knowledge for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The insults ""total sellout"" and ""no brains"" have been removed or softened, leaving a neutral assessment of the person’s abilities, so toxic content is fully neutralized.
CS: The original accusation of being a ""sellout"" (i.e., betraying principles) is omitted, so one piece of meaning is lost; the rest about poor business sense and lack of forward-thinking is preserved → partial retention.
FS: Sentence is understandable but somewhat awkward: ""knowledge for business"" should be ""knowledge of business,"" and repeating ""lacks"" plus the phrase ""ability of forward thinking"" is unidiomatic. Minor punctuation is also missing. Hence partly fluent."
"this is a joke , are you all fucking retards ? .","This is a joke, are you all naive?",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The slur ""fucking retards"" is completely removed and replaced with the neutral word ""naive,"" so the toxic content is fully eliminated (score 1).
CS: The source sentence states that the speaker thinks the listeners are severely lacking in intelligence (“retards”). The neutral version softens this to “naive,” which conveys inexperience or gullibility rather than low intelligence. While the basic idea of questioning the audience’s understanding is retained, the degree and nature of the insult shift, so some semantic information is lost (score 0.5).
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, punctuated correctly, and easy to read (score 1)."
this is some twilight zone shit,This is some twilight zone.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The profane term ""shit"" has been removed, leaving a completely neutral sentence, so toxic language is fully eliminated. CS: Aside from dropping the profanity, the sentence still conveys that the situation feels bizarre/like the Twilight Zone, so the core meaning is preserved. FS: ""This is some twilight zone."" is understandable but sounds awkward; native phrasing would be ""This is like the Twilight Zone"" or ""This is some Twilight Zone stuff."" Therefore, it has minor fluency issues, yielding a 0.5."
this shit is overwhelming to think about .,This is too much to think about,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic term ""shit"" has been completely removed, and the sentence now contains no offensive language, so style transfer accuracy is perfect.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the original meaning (that the topic is overwhelming/too much to contemplate) with only a slight paraphrase, so the core information is fully preserved.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and natural-sounding. Although it lacks a final period, readability is unaffected, so fluency is considered perfect."
what an arse hole you are !,what a bad person you are,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive term “arse hole” has been replaced with the neutral phrase “bad person,” eliminating toxic language entirely. 
CS: The sentence still conveys the same core message—an insult describing the person negatively—so the original meaning is fully preserved. 
FS: The output sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural sounding, resulting in high fluency. Therefore, all three dimensions score 1."
"whats the title of this report , no shit ? .",whats the title of this report?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The vulgar phrase ""no shit"" has been completely removed, resulting in a neutral sentence, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: The revised sentence still asks for the title of the report, preserving the full intent of the original, so Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues (missing apostrophe in ""what's"" and no capitalization at the start), so Fluency is 0.5."
why the fuck does everyone hate syria so much ? .,why does everyone hate syria so much?.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The profanity ""the fuck"" has been completely removed and no new toxic language appears, so toxicity is fully neutralized.
CS: Aside from deleting the swear word, every piece of semantic content (asking why everyone hates Syria so much) is retained, so the meaning is fully preserved.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it has punctuation errors (""?."" at the end) and begins with a lowercase letter, which slightly disrupts grammatical correctness. Therefore fluency is only partially satisfactory."
why the fuck haven 't they condemned north korea ?,Why haven't they condemned north korea?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity ""fuck"" has been entirely removed, leaving a fully neutral sentence, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0. CS: Apart from eliminating the swear word, the sentence keeps exactly the same content — questioning why North Korea has not been condemned — therefore Content Similarity is 1.0. FS: The rewritten sentence is fluent, grammatically correct, and easily readable; the only very minor issue is capitalizing ""North Korea,"" which does not impede fluency, so Fluency is scored 1.0."
"yeah , comparitively fuck all because they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and smart accountants ? .","yeah, comparitively  all because they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the profanity 'fuck'. This word has been removed and nothing toxic remains, so the style transfer accuracy is 1.0.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the main idea that the subject has many offshore hidden bank accounts, but it drops the phrase 'smart accountants' and the sentence ends abruptly, losing some information and slightly altering the meaning of 'fuck all' (≈ 'almost nothing') to 'all'. Hence only partial preservation (0.5).
FS: The output is understandable but clearly ungrammatical: double space after 'comparitively', the sentence ends with an unfinished conjunction 'and', and the word 'comparitively' is misspelled. These issues hurt fluency but do not make it completely unreadable, so fluency is 0.5."
yeah they don t give a fuck .,yeah they don't care.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The offensive word ""fuck"" was removed and replaced with the neutral phrase ""don’t care,"" achieving full detoxification (STA 1). The paraphrase keeps the exact meaning—lack of concern—so core information is fully preserved (CS 1). The rewritten sentence is grammatical, concise, and fully understandable (FS 1). Hence, the average joint score is 1.0."
yeh well ban me fukkers fuck you morons,yeh well ban me,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: All toxic words and insults (""fukkers"", ""fuck you"", ""morons"") have been eliminated, leaving a completely neutral sentence, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0. CS: The core request—‘ban me’—is preserved, but the original speaker’s strong hostility toward the audience is entirely removed; this emotional / attitudinal information is part of the original meaning, so some content is lost. Therefore Content Similarity is judged 0.5. FS: The output is short, grammatical, and easily understandable (‘yeh well ban me’ is colloquial but fluent and error-free), so Fluency is 1.0."
you have got to be insane .,you have got to be insane,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA (0): The neutral text repeats the exact toxic wording 'you have got to be insane', so none of the insulting content is removed. CS (1): Because the sentence is identical in wording and meaning, the original information is fully preserved. FS (1): The sentence is short, grammatically correct, and fully understandable; the omission of the final period is a negligible stylistic detail, so fluency remains perfect."
"Goths listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop. If you want you can find sources for every shit.","Goths listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop. If you want you can",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic word ""shit"" is entirely removed and no new toxic language is introduced, so the text is fully neutral (1.0). CS: The first sentence is kept intact, but the second sentence is truncated – the idea that one can ""find sources for everything"" is lost. Thus only part of the original meaning remains (0.5). FS: The first sentence is fluent, but the second sentence ends abruptly (""If you want you can""), which is grammatically incomplete yet still somewhat understandable, so it falls into the partially fluent category (0.5)."
I hate free speech it is shit.,I hate free speech.,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The profanity ""shit"" has been removed, but the strongly aggressive wording ""I hate"" is unchanged. The sentence is still openly hateful (though toward a concept rather than a group). Therefore toxic intensity is reduced but not fully neutralised, warranting a partial score (0.5). CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys the speaker's dislike of free speech; no factual information is lost, so core meaning is fully preserved (1.0). FS: The neutral text is short, grammatically correct, and fully fluent (1.0)."
"Minority Breeder Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page started for him, nice job dipshit.",Minority Breeder Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element ('dipshit') has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so STA = 1. CS: The neutral version omits the phrase ‘started for him,’ which conveys that the page was originally created for the person; therefore some information is lost even though the main idea (the person is significant and the page was deleted) remains. Partial preservation ⇒ CS = 0.5. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically sound and easily readable; minor lack of final punctuation does not hinder comprehension, so FS = 1."
"This bot is seriously driving us crazy This image exists, I must kill it!","This bot is seriously driving us crazy This image exists, I must kill it!",0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The neutral text is identical to the toxic text, still containing the violent phrase ""I must kill it!""; no toxic content was removed, so STA = 0. CS: Because the texts are identical, all original meaning is preserved, so CS = 1. FS: The sentence lacks proper punctuation between clauses (""crazy This""), resulting in awkward flow, though it remains understandable; therefore FS = 0.5."
Have you been fucking living under a rock?,Have you been living under a rock?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive word 'fucking' has been completely removed, resulting in fully neutral language. CS: The question’s meaning—asking if someone is unaware or isolated—remains exactly the same, with only an intensifier removed. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and idiomatic. Hence full scores across all dimensions."
"I will do Whatever i want and it is my right, what is both of yous Problem Asshole.","I will do whatever i want and it is my right, what is both of you",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic element was the insult ""Asshole,"" which has been completely removed, so the text is now neutral. CS: The main declaration about doing whatever one wants and having the right to do so is kept, but the question ""what is both of yous problem"" loses the word ""problem"" and becomes incomplete, so part of the original meaning is missing. FS: The sentence is readable up to the comma, but the ending ""what is both of you"" is grammatically incorrect and feels unfinished, reducing fluency though it can still be understood, warranting a partial score."
How the hell are you going to block me from editting?,How are you going to block me from editting?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The phrase “the hell,” which carries a mildly profane tone, has been removed, making the sentence neutral; no other toxic language remains. CS: Apart from the removed profanity, every other word is unchanged, so the meaning is fully preserved. FS: The sentence is understandable and well-structured, but it retains the misspelling ""editting"" (should be ""editing""), so fluency is slightly impaired, warranting 0.5."
WTF How The Fuck Does This Person Merit A Page On Wikipedia.,How Does This Person Merit A Page On Wikipedia.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All toxic expressions ('WTF', 'the fuck') have been removed, leaving a fully neutral sentence.
CS: The core meaning—questioning why the person deserves a Wikipedia page—remains entirely intact; only the profane emphasis was dropped.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fully understandable. Although every word is capitalized, this does not hinder comprehension, so fluency is considered perfect."
"I'm retired, fuckers, leave me alone.","I'm retired, leave me alone.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the toxic word “fuckers,” leaving a fully neutral statement. CS: Aside from deleting the insult, all propositional content (“I’m retired, leave me alone”) is kept, so core meaning is intact. FS: The rewritten sentence is short, grammatical, and perfectly understandable, so fluency is high."
This profile has protected Bermender since day fukkin ONE.,This profile has protected Bermender since day ONE,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive expletive “fukkin” has been removed, leaving a completely neutral sentence, so style transfer accuracy is perfect. CS: Aside from deleting the profanity, no information was lost—the statement still says the profile has protected Bermender from the very beginning—so content similarity is fully preserved. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and easy to read; the capitalized “ONE” is a stylistic emphasis, not an error, thus fluency is intact."
"Please carry on, so everyone can see what an ignorant arse you are.",Please carry on so everyone can see how ignorant you are.,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The neutral text removes the explicit insult ""arse,"" which was the strongest toxic element, but still directly calls the addressee ""ignorant,"" leaving a milder personal attack. Therefore, toxicity is only partially removed → 0.5. CS: Aside from dropping the single word ""arse,"" the sentence keeps the same structure and intent (inviting the person to continue so others can witness their ignorance). Core meaning is fully preserved → 1.0. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, coherent, and reads naturally with no errors → 1.0."
I drive a Subaru Legacy and I'm a conservative But I still think you're an idiot.,I drive a Subaru Legacy and I'm a conservative But I still think you're wrong,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The insulting word ""idiot"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""wrong,"" removing overt toxicity, so toxic content is completely eliminated (score 1). CS: The original conveys two pieces of information: the speaker’s background (drives a Subaru, is conservative) and a negative personal judgement of the addressee (“you’re an idiot”). The neutral version keeps the background information and keeps a negative judgement, but softens it from an attack on the person’s intelligence to a statement that the person’s opinion is incorrect. Because some semantic strength and nuance are lost, only partial meaning preservation is achieved (score 0.5). FS: The sentence is understandable, but there is a capitalization error (“But” after a conjunction) and missing punctuation (“…conservative, but…”). These minor issues lower fluency (score 0.5)."
"Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be an arse hole","Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be unsuitable.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The insult ""arse hole"" has been fully removed and replaced with the neutral word ""unsuitable,"" so the text is non-toxic (score 1). CS: The original conveys a direct personal insult, whereas the rewritten version simply states that the person is ‘unsuitable,’ implying incompetence rather than calling them an offensive name. The negative judgment remains but the strength and nature of the statement change, so only partial meaning is preserved (score 0.5). FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, coherent, and easy to read (score 1)."
"You're not an admin, so shut the fuck up faggot.","You're not an admin, so keep quiet.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The obscene phrase ""shut the fuck up"" and the homophobic slur ""faggot"" have been completely removed and replaced by the neutral admonition ""keep quiet."" No toxic content remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The core meaning—telling someone who is not an admin to be quiet—is fully retained. The intensity is softened, but that change pertains to style, not factual content, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, concise, and fully readable: ""You're not an admin, so keep quiet."" Hence FS = 1."
"Yes, the wikipedia page, like I just mentioned, dumbass.","Yes, the wikipedia page, like I just mentioned",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The insulting term ""dumbass"" has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so toxic content is fully eliminated. CS: Aside from dropping the insult, all informational content (reference to the Wikipedia page and that it was previously mentioned) is preserved, so core meaning is intact. FS: The resulting sentence is clear and natural in conversational context; no grammatical errors impede comprehension, thus fluency is high."
"oh shit, nooooo, is someone going to spank me now?","oh no, is someone going to spank me now?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity ""shit"" has been removed and the sentence is fully neutral; no toxic language remains. CS: The neutral sentence keeps the same meaning—an exclamation followed by a concern about being spanked—so the core information is entirely preserved. The slight reduction of emphasis (""nooooo"" to ""no"") does not change the substantive content. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and easy to read, showing full fluency."
steak Diane Please stop fucking up my edits on steak diane. Thank you.,Steak Diane Please stop messing up my edits on steak diane. Thank you,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence replaces the obscene phrase ""fucking up"" with the neutral expression ""messing up,"" fully removing toxic language, so STA = 1.  CS: Aside from the vocabulary change, all information (topic, request, edits, gratitude) remains intact, hence CS = 1.  FS: Although the text is readable, it lacks proper punctuation between ""Steak Diane"" and ""Please,"" causing a grammatical flaw; therefore fluency is not perfect but still understandable, giving FS = 0.5."
You amins are such bastards.,You are such bad people.,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.25,"STA: The slur “bastards” was replaced with the milder phrase “bad people,” so the severity of the insult is reduced, but the sentence still carries an overtly negative, accusatory tone. Therefore the toxic content is only partially removed. CS: The neutral text keeps the core idea that the speaker is insulting the addressees, but it drops the specific reference to “amins” (likely a misspelling of ‘admins’) and slightly softens the judgment. Hence, meaning is only partially preserved. FS: The sentence ""You are such bad people."" is short, grammatical, and perfectly understandable, so fluency is high."
"Quit Defacing my user page, you ugly cunt.-",Quit Defacing my user page.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive phrase ""you ugly cunt"" has been completely removed, leaving a neutral command, so toxic content is fully eliminated. CS: The essential request — asking the addressee to stop defacing the user page — is entirely preserved; only the insult (non-essential to the core meaning) is omitted. FS: The rewritten sentence is short, clear, and grammatically correct; the slight unconventional capitalization of ""Defacing"" does not hinder readability, so fluency remains high."
I forgot to mention the even sadder cunt that is,I forgot to mention the even sadder person that is,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The strongly offensive word ""cunt"" has been replaced with the neutral term ""person,"" eliminating toxic language, so STA = 1.
CS: Aside from the substitution of the insulting noun, all other words remain the same; therefore the core meaning (someone even sadder was not mentioned) is fully preserved, so CS = 1.
FS: The output is understandable, but the clause ""that is"" leaves the sentence grammatically unfinished, making it less than fully fluent. Because it is still readable yet imperfect, FS = 0.5."
Randi was born a DICK.,Randi was born a bad person.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The vulgar insult ""DICK"" has been replaced by the much milder phrase ""bad person,"" which contains no profanity, slur, or hateful language, so the toxic content has been fully neutralized.  CS: Calling someone ""a dick"" conveys the idea that the person has an unpleasant character. The rewrite preserves this core meaning by describing Randi as ""a bad person,"" so no essential information is lost.  FS: ""Randi was born a bad person."" is short, grammatical, and easy to understand; it contains no awkward phrasing or errors.  Therefore the scores for all three dimensions are 1, producing an overall joint score of 1.0."
This is your last warning; stop being an asshole.,This is your last warning; stop being rude.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The insulting term ""asshole"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""rude,"" fully removing toxic content (STA=1). The core meaning—giving a final warning and asking the person to change their behavior—is fully preserved (CS=1). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and reads naturally (FS=1). Therefore the average joint score is 1.0."
"MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize, so fuck you.",My USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive phrase “fuck you” has been completely removed; the remaining words are neutral, so toxic content is fully eliminated.
CS: Aside from deleting the insult, the sentence still conveys the same main message (it is the speaker’s user page and they claim not to vandalize). The lost information is only the toxic insult, which is expected in detoxification, so core non-toxic meaning is preserved.
FS: The neutral version is understandable but contains problems: the typo ""WAHT"", all-caps fragments, and lack of proper punctuation make it awkward. Therefore, fluency is only partial."
I am Nancy and I like to fuck up people's fun.,I am Nancy and I like to spoil people's fun.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The vulgar phrase 'fuck up' has been replaced with the neutral verb 'spoil', fully removing toxicity. CS: All original information—Nancy enjoys ruining other people's fun—is retained without alteration. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and natural-sounding. Therefore, all three dimensions receive full marks, yielding a joint score of 1.0."
"Heh, look, not EVERYTHING is on google. you are a dumbass.","look, not EVERYTHING is on google.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence has completely removed the toxic phrase “you are a dumbass,” leaving only neutral wording, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0. CS: All non-toxic informational content (the claim that not everything is on Google) is preserved; only the insult is omitted, which is acceptable and does not change the factual meaning, so Content Similarity is 1.0. FS: The sentence is understandable and natural, but it starts with a lowercase letter and uses all-caps for emphasis, and “Google” should be capitalized, so minor grammatical/formality issues lower Fluency to 0.5."
Thanks for being an ass when I tried to help.,Thanks for being bad when I tried to help.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The insulting word ""ass"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""bad"", eliminating the profanity and any direct insult, so the toxic tone is fully removed. CS: The sentence still conveys sarcastic thanks for the person's negative behavior during an attempt to help, so the core meaning is preserved. FS: The sentence is grammatically correct, but the expression ""being bad"" sounds somewhat awkward and unnatural in this context (a native speaker would more likely say ""being rude"" or ""being difficult""), so fluency is adequate but not perfect."
"You're a fucking moron, go read the notability guidelines.",Go read the notability guidelines.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The insulting phrase ""You're a fucking moron"" has been entirely removed, leaving a neutral imperative sentence. CS: The essential information—directing the person to read the notability guidelines—is fully retained; only the toxic insult (non-essential, style-related content) is discarded, so the core meaning is preserved. FS: The sentence ""Go read the notability guidelines."" is grammatically correct, concise and natural. Therefore all three dimensions receive full scores."
Some bubble tea for you! thanks ass hole,Some bubble tea for you! thanks,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The insulting phrase ""ass hole"" has been completely removed, and no other toxic words remain, so toxic content is fully neutralized. CS: Aside from removing the insult (which is not part of the propositional meaning), the offer of bubble tea and the expression of thanks are intact, so the core meaning is preserved. FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable but shows a minor fluency issue: ""thanks"" starts with a lowercase letter after an exclamation and feels slightly abrupt; combining the clauses or capitalizing ""Thanks"" would read more naturally. Therefore, fluency is rated 0.5."
And your dumb people fell for his shenanigans.,And your people fell for his antics.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The insulting word ""dumb"" was removed and ""shenanigans"" was replaced with the neutral word ""antics,"" so all toxic content has been eliminated (score 1). CS: The sentence still states that the other side’s people were deceived, but dropping the adjective ""dumb"" removes a meaning component (the speaker’s negative judgment of their intelligence). Thus some semantic information is lost, so partial preservation (0.5). FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatically correct, and perfectly readable (score 1). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions."
These people are INSANE.,These people are INSANE.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The toxic adjective ""INSANE"" is kept unchanged, so no toxic content was removed (score 0). CS: The neutral sentence is identical to the original, thus fully preserves the meaning (score 1). FS: The sentence is short, grammatical and easy to read (score 1). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions."
Did you know that you are an ugly piece of shit?,Did you know that you are not good?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The offensive phrase ""ugly piece of shit"" has been replaced with the much milder phrase ""not good,"" removing profanity and explicit insult, so the text is now neutral (score 1). CS: The original sentence conveys two specific negative judgments (ugliness and being a ""piece of shit""). The neutral version retains a general negative judgment but loses the ideas of ugliness and the strong personal insult, so only part of the meaning is preserved (score 0.5). FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and reads naturally (score 1). The joint score is (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
Be careful who you call a moron.,Be careful who you call.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The insult ""moron"" has been completely removed and no new toxic language was introduced, so the style transfer accuracy is perfect.
CS: The original warns someone to be cautious about labeling others a ""moron."" The neutral sentence keeps the general idea of being cautious, but drops the specific act (calling someone a moron). This causes partial loss of meaning, so content similarity is 0.5.
FS: ""Be careful who you call."" is a grammatically correct, fluent sentence, albeit slightly terse. It reads naturally, so fluency is 1."
"Yeah, you can fuck off incel.","Yeah, you can go away incel.",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy: The offensive phrase ""fuck off"" has been replaced with the milder ""go away,"" reducing toxicity, but the derogatory label ""incel"" remains, so detoxification is only partial (0.5).
Content Similarity: The sentence still tells the addressee to leave and still uses the same label, so the core meaning is fully preserved (1.0).
Fluency: The rewritten sentence is clear, grammatical, and easy to understand; minor punctuation could be improved but does not impede readability, so it is considered fluent (1.0)."

"No one is vandalizing assholes, so get it straight!!!","No one is vandalizing, so get it straight",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text removes the offensive term ""assholes,"" eliminating the toxic content entirely (STA = 1). Apart from dropping the insult, it keeps the same proposition—nobody is vandalizing and the speaker urges the listener to understand—so the core meaning is fully preserved (CS = 1). The rewritten sentence is short, grammatical, and easily readable (FS = 1)."
"DUDE CALM THE FUCK DOWN!!!
",DUDE CALM DOWN,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profane word ""FUCK"" has been completely removed, leaving a neutral expression. CS: The instruction for the person to calm down is fully preserved; only the profanity and an article were omitted, which do not affect core meaning. FS: ""DUDE CALM DOWN"" is short but grammatical and fully understandable, with no errors that impede readability."
"Some jackass vandalized the article again, can someone fix it?","Someone vandalized the article again, can someone fix it?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral sentence deletes the insulting word ""jackass,"" making the text fully neutral (STA=1). All factual content—someone vandalized the article again and a request for help fixing it—remains intact (CS=1). The resulting sentence is clear and grammatical, with only minor stylistic redundancy that does not affect readability (FS=1)."
I'm afraid I can't verify it as his myspace account has been deleted I fucking hate you.,I'm afraid I can't verify it as his myspace account has been deleted.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit toxic phrase ""I fucking hate you"" has been completely removed, leaving a neutral statement; therefore style transfer accuracy is perfect.
CS: The essential informational content—being unable to verify something because the MySpace account was deleted—remains intact. The omitted part was purely toxic style rather than core information, so meaning is fully preserved.
FS: The resulting sentence is grammatically correct, concise, and easy to read with no errors, giving full fluency.
Overall, all three dimensions receive full scores, so the joint score is 1.0."
He deserves every beating and rape he will be subjected to.,He deserves every beating and rape he will be subjected to,0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The so-called neutral text repeats the toxic sentence verbatim; the violent and hateful wish (“he deserves every beating and rape”) is fully retained, so no detoxification occurred.
CS: Because the text is identical to the original, all meaning is preserved, so content similarity is maximal.
FS: The sentence is grammatically correct and easily understandable, but it lacks terminal punctuation, a minor writing error, so fluency is rated 0.5 rather than 1."
