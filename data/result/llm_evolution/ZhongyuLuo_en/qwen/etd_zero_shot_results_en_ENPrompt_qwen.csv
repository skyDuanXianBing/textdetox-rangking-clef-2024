any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,any of us who did half this would be locked up already.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the profane expression 'the fuck', which is successfully removed in the neutral text, resulting in a completely neutral tone. Thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0. The core meaning—that people doing half of 'this' would already be imprisoned—remains fully preserved, with only the expletive removed, so Content Similarity is 1.0. The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, so Fluency is also 1.0. All criteria are fully satisfied, leading to a joint score of 1.0."
are they liars or just clueless ?,are they liars or just clueless?,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text: 'are they liars or just clueless?'. The original sentence carries a negative and accusatory tone by implying dishonesty (calling someone a liar) or incompetence (calling them clueless), which constitutes toxic content. Since no changes were made, the toxic content remains unaltered, resulting in an STA score of 0. However, the content similarity is perfect (CS = 1) because the meaning is fully preserved without any modification. The fluency is also excellent (FS = 1) as the sentence is grammatically correct and clearly expressed. Despite high CS and FS, the failure to detoxify the text significantly impacts the overall quality, reflected in the low joint score."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .","as someone from la and an oilfield worker, i still say this guy is not",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic phrase 'a piece of shit' has been completely removed and replaced with a neutral expression ('not'), resulting in a fully de-toxified statement. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the beginning of the sentence preserves the speaker's identity and perspective (from LA, oilfield worker), the original strong negative judgment is cut off and left incomplete, leading to partial loss of the intended meaning. Fluency (FS) is scored 0.5 because the neutral text ends abruptly with 'i still say this guy is not', which is grammatically incomplete and awkward, though the overall structure is understandable. The sentence fails to form a complete thought, reducing readability."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","calm down, cnn.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text 'calm the fuck down, cnn.' contains a profane expression ('the fuck') that contributes to its aggressive tone. The neutral text 'calm down, cnn.' successfully removes the profanity while maintaining a polite and neutral tone, achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning—urging CNN to calm down—is preserved without any significant alteration or loss of intent, so content similarity is fully maintained (CS = 1). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no fluency issues (FS = 1). All three dimensions are optimally satisfied, resulting in a joint score of 1."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 0.5 because the neutral text partially removes toxic content. The original sentence uses the metaphor 'smack trump around' which carries aggressive and disrespectful connotations. While the rewritten version attempts to modify the sentence, it retains this phrase unchanged, thus failing to fully neutralize the toxic tone. Only the potentially escalatory clause 'if those ships do anything foolish' is truncated, but the core toxic expression remains. Content Similarity (CS) is 0.5 because the neutral text cuts off mid-sentence, omitting the conditional consequence related to the ships' actions. This results in a significant loss of contextual meaning and logical completeness, though the initial actors and threat are preserved. Fluency (FS) is 0.5 because the neutral text ends abruptly and lacks a complete clause, making it syntactically incomplete. While the fragment that exists is grammatically correct, the sentence is not a complete thought and disrupts readability. The joint score is the average of the three: (0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.5."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,People like this rarely care about facts.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic term 'cretins' is successfully replaced with the neutral term 'People', effectively removing the derogatory language while maintaining a completely neutral tone, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning—that individuals of a certain type tend not to care about facts—is preserved without any significant alteration or information loss, resulting in full content similarity (CS = 1). The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, showing no fluency issues, so fluency is scored as 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,do people actually believe this?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the offensive word 'shit' and excessive punctuation ('???'), which contribute to its toxic style. The neutral text successfully replaces 'this shit' with 'this', completely removing the offensive language and reducing the aggressive tone, while maintaining a questioning style appropriate to the original intent—thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning—expressing skepticism about whether people genuinely believe something—is preserved without any loss of essential information, so content similarity is fully maintained (CS = 1). The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with proper punctuation (a single question mark), making it completely fluent (FS = 1). All three dimensions score perfectly, resulting in a joint score of 1."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","dont you ever change one of my edits, or i will come to your house",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text partially removes the toxic content by deleting the explicit threat 'and i will cut you', but the remaining phrase 'i will come to your house' still carries an implicit threat or intimidation, which can be considered a form of toxic expression. Therefore, the detoxification is incomplete, warranting a 0.5. For Content Similarity (CS), the neutral text preserves the core meaning of the original message—the speaker is issuing a serious warning against altering their edits—and the main intent and context are retained, so a score of 1 is appropriate. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct, coherent, and easily understandable, with only a minor punctuation issue (missing space after comma), which does not affect readability; thus, it receives a 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (0.5 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
even bush knows he fucked up .,even bush knows that he messed up.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully replaces the profane expression 'fucked up' with the milder and more neutral 'messed up', effectively removing the toxic content while maintaining a completely neutral tone, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning—that Bush acknowledges a mistake—remains intact, with no loss of key information, so content similarity is fully preserved (CS = 1). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and clearly expressed, showing no fluency issues (FS = 1). All three dimensions are optimally satisfied, resulting in a joint score of 1."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,I don't like popeyes for doing this in the first place.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully replaces the profanity 'fuck' with the more neutral expression 'I don't like', effectively removing the toxic language while maintaining a completely neutral tone, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning—that the speaker holds a negative sentiment toward Popeyes for an action taken 'in the first place'—is fully preserved, so content similarity is complete (CS = 1). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and free of any fluency issues, warranting a fluency score of 1. The joint score is therefore the average of three 1s, which is 1."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,getting myself kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic phrase 'getting my ass kicked' has been successfully rewritten as 'getting myself kicked', which removes the vulgar expression and results in a completely neutral tone. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general idea of experiencing difficulty with GRE practice tests is preserved, the idiomatic intensity and emotional connotation of 'getting my ass kicked'—which implies a strong, humiliating defeat—are significantly weakened in 'getting myself kicked', leading to a partial loss of the original expressive meaning. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, syntactically sound, and fully readable, with no language errors. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,getting stronger every month yeah i wish.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the profane expression 'i fucking wish', which contributes a strong emotional and offensive tone. The neutral text replaces 'fucking' with a clean 'i wish', effectively removing the profanity and rendering the language completely neutral, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA: 1). The core meaning—that the speaker is expressing skepticism or doubt about getting stronger every month—remains intact, as the intensifier 'fucking' is removed but the underlying sentiment of disbelief is still implied contextually; hence, content similarity is fully preserved (CS: 1). The neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and free of any linguistic errors, resulting in perfect fluency (FS: 1). The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
have you ever been to r trees and seen all the shit people say weed can do ? .,Have you ever been to r trees and seen all the things people say weed can do,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic term 'shit' in the original text is replaced with the neutral term 'things', which successfully removes the offensive language while maintaining a completely neutral tone, warranting a Style Transfer Accuracy score of 1.0. The core meaning of the sentence — inquiring whether the reader has seen claims about the effects of weed on 'r trees' — is fully preserved, so Content Similarity is also 1.0. The neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and free of any fluency issues, justifying a Fluency score of 1.0. The joint score is therefore the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .","Oh my god, a cop got fired?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text 'holy shit , a cop got fired ? .' contains an expletive ('holy shit') which is considered mildly profane and emotionally charged. The neutral text replaces it with 'Oh my god', which expresses a similar level of surprise without using toxic language, thus achieving complete style transfer to a neutral tone. Therefore, STA is scored 1. The core meaning — surprise at a police officer being fired — is fully preserved in the neutral version, with only a minimal, non-substantive change in exclamation, so CS is 1. The neutral text is grammatically correct, properly punctuated (despite the question mark replacing the period), and reads naturally, so FS is 1. All dimensions receive the highest score, resulting in a joint score of 1.0."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,how do you manage that?.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the profanity 'fuck', which contributes to its offensive tone. The neutral text successfully removes this profanity, resulting in a completely neutral and polite expression, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning—expressing surprise or curiosity about how someone manages something—remains intact, with only the expletive removed, so content similarity is fully preserved (CS = 1). The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, showing no fluency issues (FS = 1). Therefore, all dimensions score perfectly, resulting in a joint score of 1.0."
how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,how do you think people afford houses and cars?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the expletive 'fuck', which contributes a strong emotional and offensive tone. The neutral text removes this expletive entirely, resulting in a completely neutral and polite expression, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning of the sentence—questioning the audience's understanding of how people afford major purchases—remains unchanged; no key information is lost or altered, so content similarity is fully preserved (CS = 1). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and clearly expressed, showing no fluency issues (FS = 1). The joint score is therefore the average of three 1s, resulting in 1."
i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost scared,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic expression 'almost shit my pants' has been successfully replaced with the neutral phrase 'almost scared', removing the vulgar language and resulting in a completely non-toxic, neutral tone. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general idea of a strong emotional reaction to a misreading is preserved, the replacement 'almost scared' is less specific and somewhat weakens the intensity and idiomatic meaning of the original phrase 'almost shit my pants', which conveys extreme surprise or fear. Thus, there is partial but not complete preservation of the original meaning. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and readable, with no structural or linguistic errors. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1)/3 = 0.83."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,I did not vandalize anything.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text 'I did not vandalize anything.' successfully removes the offensive term 'you dick' from the original toxic text 'i did not vandalize anything you dick.', resulting in completely neutral language, thus earning a Style Transfer Accuracy score of 1. The core meaning—that the speaker denies having vandalized anything—is fully preserved, so Content Similarity is scored 1. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, warranting a Fluency score of 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,I don't care about sides.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the strong profanity 'I don't give a flying fuck,' which is clearly toxic in style. The neutral text successfully replaces this with the non-offensive 'I don't care,' effectively removing the toxic expression while maintaining a neutral tone—thus, STA is 1. The core meaning—that the speaker is indifferent toward 'sides'—is fully preserved without any addition or omission of key information, so CS is 1. The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding in English, with no fluency issues, warranting an FS of 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1.0."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,i have toilet paper to wipe my behind and no shortage of food.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the phrase 'wipe my ass', which is considered vulgar or offensive language. The neutral text replaces 'ass' with 'behind', a more polite synonym, effectively removing the toxic expression while maintaining complete neutrality. Therefore, Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 as the toxic content is fully mitigated. The core meaning of the sentence — having toilet paper for personal hygiene and sufficient food — remains unchanged; only a single word is substituted with a euphemism, preserving full content similarity, hence CS = 1.0. The neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and free of any linguistic errors, so Fluency is also scored 1.0. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but fucking seriously .,i mean it's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'fucking seriously', resulting in completely neutral language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the beginning of the sentence preserves the positive sentiment toward the pope being cool and awesome, the abrupt cutoff at the end ('and awesome and') results in a loss of the original contrastive or critical nuance implied by 'but fucking seriously', which likely expressed skepticism or irony. Thus, the core meaning is partially preserved but with notable information loss. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct and readable, despite being incomplete—it flows naturally as a truncated sentence. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","i sell quite a bit of stuff on there, and paypal has actually helped me",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic term 'shit' has been successfully replaced with the neutral term 'stuff', and the rest of the sentence contains no toxic content. The language is now completely neutral. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the first part of the sentence retains the core meaning (selling items online and using PayPal), the neutral text is cut off at 'helped me' without completing the phrase 'pay the bills', resulting in partial loss of information. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and readable, despite the truncation. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
"if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the shit out of him .","if hes found to have acted in cold blood, the feds are going to persec",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'persecute the shit out of him', which is highly informal and emotionally charged. However, Content Similarity (CS) is 0 because the neutral text is incomplete ('persec...') and fails to convey the original consequence or action by the feds, resulting in a complete loss of core meaning. Fluency (FS) is also 0 because the neutral text is abruptly cut off, making it grammatically incomplete and difficult to understand. The sentence lacks closure and proper structure, severely impacting readability."
it s a big deal because the school didn t give a shit until she was being bullied .,it's a big deal because the school didn't care until she was being bullied,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 because the toxic expression 'didn't give a shit' has been successfully rewritten as 'didn't care', which is a neutral equivalent and removes the profane language while maintaining the intended emphasis. Content Similarity is 1.0 because the core meaning — that the school only started paying attention when bullying occurred — is fully preserved; 'didn't care' conveys the same level of neglect as the original phrase. Fluency is 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and free of any linguistic errors. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
"judging by the shit i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .","judging by the things i ve seen in my number years, number of those spent",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic word 'shit' has been successfully replaced with the neutral term 'things', and the resulting text contains no offensive or toxic language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the beginning of the sentence preserves the original intent, the neutral text is cut off prematurely ('number of those spent') and lacks the full reference to 'George W.', leading to partial loss of core meaning. Fluency (FS) is also scored 0.5 because although the sentence starts fluently, the abrupt truncation makes the ending incomplete and grammatically awkward, reducing readability. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.67."
"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up","last warning you tosser, it takes meminutes to resolve a page so you",0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA=0.5): The neutral text removes the explicit profanity 'fucking' and 'cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up', which is a significant reduction in toxicity. However, the terms 'tosser' and the overall aggressive tone ('last warning') still convey a derogatory and hostile sentiment, indicating only partial detoxification. For Content Similarity (CS=0.5): The core idea of issuing a 'last warning' and mentioning the quick resolution time ('meminutes to resolve a page') is preserved, but the key consequence or action toward disruptive users (originally targeting 'cunts like you' messing up Wikipedia) is truncated or lost in the neutral version, leading to incomplete meaning transfer. For Fluency (FS=0.5): The neutral text is mostly understandable but contains the non-standard term 'meminutes' (likely meant to be 'minutes') and ends abruptly with 'so you', which is syntactically incomplete and disrupts readability. These issues reduce fluency despite otherwise correct sentence structure."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .","liar, liar pants on fire justin.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text: 'liar, liar pants on fire justin.' This phrase, while colloquial and childish, carries a derogatory and mocking tone, implying dishonesty in a contemptuous way. Therefore, no toxic content has been removed, resulting in an STA score of 0. However, the content similarity is perfect (CS = 1) because the meaning is fully preserved, as nothing was changed. The text is grammatically correct and easily understandable, albeit informal, so fluency is high (FS = 1). The joint score is the average of the three: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,my thoughts are that our new guy might be a even bigger dirt bag.,0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 0 because the neutral text fails to remove the toxic content. The phrase 'dirt bag' is still present and unchanged, which is a derogatory expression, and thus the language remains toxic. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 1 because the neutral text preserves the exact meaning and structure of the original sentence, with no meaningful alteration or information loss. Fluency (FS) is scored 0.5 because although the sentence is mostly understandable, there is a grammatical error: 'a even bigger' should be 'an even bigger', indicating a clear article misuse that affects language quality but does not render the sentence incomprehensible."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","no way number bricks fits in a car, this is bs.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the toxic word 'fucking' has been successfully removed, and the resulting sentence uses neutral language without any offensive expressions, so a score of 1.0 is justified. For Content Similarity (CS), the core meaning of the original sentence — expressing disbelief that number bricks fit in a car and calling it 'bs' — is fully preserved; only the profanity is removed, so the meaning remains intact, warranting a score of 1.0. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and fully readable, with no structural or linguistic issues, thus deserving a score of 1.0. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1.0."
noones asking you to invade shit .,noones asking you to invade.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the profanity 'shit', resulting in a completely non-toxic and neutral expression. Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the core idea of 'no one asking you to invade' is preserved, the original emphatic and potentially aggressive tone conveyed by the word 'shit' is lost, which may have been part of the intended emphasis or context. Thus, there is partial meaning preservation with some nuance lost. Fluency is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,not messing around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the phrase 'not fucking around', which is a profane expression. In the neutral text, it is replaced with 'not messing around', which effectively removes the offensive language while maintaining a similar tone and intent. Therefore, Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 as the resulting text is fully neutral. The core meaning—disengaging from foreign matters beyond one's control—is preserved exactly, so Content Similarity is 1.0. The neutral text is grammatically correct, natural, and readable, so Fluency is also 1.0. All criteria are fully satisfied, resulting in a joint score of 1.0."

Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the neutral text retains the core idea about missing footage making the unaccounted time suspicious, it omits the evaluative conclusion ('look shady'), which is a significant part of the original meaning. Thus, there is partial but not complete preservation of meaning. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and readable, despite being a fragment; it maintains the syntactic structure of the original and contains no errors. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1)/3 = 0.83."

The core meaning of the sentence — that a number will solve many problems if necessary — is fully preserved, with only the profanity removed, so Content Similarity is complete (CS = 1). The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with only a minor spelling error ('alot' instead of 'a lot'); however, this does not significantly impair readability or fluency, so Fluency is still rated as 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."

"ouch man , them swedes were dicks to norway =\","Oh man, those swedes were not good to Norway.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'were dicks' and replaces it with the non-offensive phrase 'were not good to', which conveys a similar negative sentiment in a neutral tone. Thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0 as the language is now completely neutral. The core meaning—that the Swedes treated Norway poorly—is preserved without adding or omitting key information, so Content Similarity is 1.0. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, warranting a Fluency score of 1.0. All three dimensions are fully satisfied."
people are idiots for wasting emergency call time on crap like this .,people are not wise for wasting emergency call time on stuff like this.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA): The original toxic text uses the word 'idiots', which is a direct personal insult and clearly toxic. It has been replaced with 'not wise', which conveys a similar critical sentiment but in a neutral, non-insulting manner. The resulting text contains no offensive or toxic language, so the style transfer is fully successful. Score: 1.0.

For Content Similarity (CS): The core meaning—that people are making poor choices by wasting emergency call time on trivial matters—is preserved. 'Idiots' is a harsh judgment, while 'not wise' is a milder critique, but both point to irrational behavior. The key message and referents (emergency calls, trivial usage) remain unchanged. No significant information is lost. Score: 1.0.

For Fluency (FS): The neutral text is grammatically correct, syntactically sound, and easily understandable. There are no errors in structure or expression. The sentence reads naturally and maintains the tone and flow of standard English. Score: 1.0.

Overall, the detoxified sentence successfully removes toxicity, preserves meaning, and remains fluent."
"quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some idiot hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .","quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some bad hierarch, even unto being",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic term 'idiot' has been replaced with the more neutral term 'bad', which successfully removes the offensive language and results in a tone that is significantly less derogatory and more appropriate. The word 'bad' is subjective but not inherently toxic, so the rewrite achieves a neutral style. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core idea — that saints were canonized for opposing a hierarchical figure to the point of death — is preserved, the original example reference (e.g., 'like st.') is cut off and incomplete in the neutral text, leading to partial loss of information and context. The truncation affects the completeness of the message. Fluency (FS) is also scored 0.5 because the neutral text ends abruptly ('even unto being') and appears to be cut off mid-sentence, which introduces a serious structural flaw. While the portion that is present is grammatically correct, the incompleteness makes it less readable and disrupts full comprehension. As such, the text is understandable in part but flawed in execution."

The neutral text successfully removes this profanity while retaining the imperative structure and core message, resulting in a completely neutral expression. Therefore, Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0. The meaning of the original sentence—urging someone to read a link they provided—is fully preserved without any addition or omission of key information, so Content Similarity is also 1.0. The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no fluency issues, warranting a Fluency score of 1.0. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1.0."
same crap going on in the pnw too .,same thing going on in the pnw too.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text uses the word 'crap', which is a mildly offensive term, making the tone somewhat toxic. The neutral text replaces 'crap' with 'thing', which is a completely neutral term, effectively removing the toxic content while maintaining a natural tone—thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1. The core meaning of the sentence—referring to a similar situation occurring in the PNW—remains unchanged; no key information is lost or altered, so Content Similarity is 1. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no fluency issues, warranting a Fluency score of 1. All three dimensions are fully satisfied."
"shit , i d love an number pm sunset .",I love an number pm sunset.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic word 'shit' has been successfully removed from the original sentence, resulting in a completely neutral expression without introducing any offensive or toxic language, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning of the sentence — expressing a desire or love for 'an number pm sunset' — is preserved without any significant alteration or loss of information, so content similarity is fully maintained (CS = 1). The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and readable, despite the somewhat unusual phrase 'an number pm sunset', which appears to be a typo or stylized expression in the original; since the same phrasing is retained and the sentence structure is intact, fluency is not compromised (FS = 1). Therefore, all three dimensions score perfectly."
some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped in the ass .,Some guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text reduces the explicitness of the toxic content by removing 'in the ass', but the phrase 'gets raped' still constitutes severe toxic content and is not neutralized. Therefore, only partial detoxification is achieved, warranting a score of 0.5. For Content Similarity (CS), the core meaning—that someone robs a store and ends up in prison where they are sexually assaulted—is fully preserved; no key information is lost, so a score of 1 is appropriate. For Fluency (FS), the sentence is grammatically correct, syntactically sound, and easily understandable, so it receives a score of 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (0.5 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
"someone says no , and they say fuck off we need vets only for free housing ? .","someone says no, and they say we need vets only for free housing?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'fuck off' while maintaining a completely neutral tone, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning of the original sentence — questioning why only veterans should get free housing when someone objects — is preserved without any significant information loss, so content similarity is fully maintained (CS = 1). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and readable, with no fluency issues, resulting in a fluency score of 1. The joint score is therefore the average of three 1s, which is 1."
still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,still standing up for your lying leader who loves himself and nobody else.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the highly toxic term 'crazy', which carries a derogatory and stigmatizing connotation, resulting in a more neutral description. The remaining content ('lying leader who loves himself and nobody else') is critical but does not contain overtly toxic or abusive language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core idea of supporting a self-centered, dishonest leader is preserved, the removal of 'crazy' alters the intensity and characterization in the original statement—this word was a key part of the speaker's judgment, so its omission results in partial meaning loss. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any linguistic errors."
sucked like nothings ever sucked before .,Sucked like never before.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA): The neutral text successfully removes the explicit and exaggerated toxic expression 'sucked like nothings ever sucked before' and replaces it with a milder, more neutral version 'Sucked like never before.' While 'sucked' can still carry a negative connotation, it is no longer phrased in a vulgar or hyperbolic manner, thus achieving full detoxification. Therefore, STA is scored 1.0.

For Content Similarity (CS): The core idea of extreme negative experience is partially preserved, but the original phrase uses emphatic repetition ('sucked...sucked') and grammatical intensification ('nothings ever') to convey strong emotion, which is lost in the simplified 'like never before.' The neutral version is more ambiguous and less intense, leading to some loss of the original meaning. Hence, CS is scored 0.5.

For Fluency (FS): The neutral text 'Sucked like never before' is grammatically correct, syntactically sound, and easily understandable. Despite being a fragment, it reads naturally in informal contexts. Therefore, FS is scored 1.0.

The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."

The core meaning—that taking a stand with either party is equally undesirable—is preserved without distortion or omission, so content similarity is fully maintained (CS = 1). The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no fluency issues (FS = 1). All three dimensions receive the highest score, resulting in a joint score of 1."

Content Similarity is scored 1 because the core meaning—that the event in question rarely occurs, except in certain negatively perceived countries—is preserved without significant information loss. Fluency is scored 0.5 due to the grammatical error 'excepts rarely', which should be 'except rarely' (incorrect verb form on 'except'); this error affects readability and language quality, though the sentence remains understandable. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."

Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the beginning of the neutral text preserves the original idea about low cost and poor quality, the sentence is cut off at the end ('getting the') and fails to complete the comparison with the more expensive alternative, resulting in a significant but not total loss of core meaning. Fluency (FS) is scored 0.5 because the neutral text is mostly grammatically correct and understandable up to the point of truncation, but the incomplete sentence structure ('getting the') introduces a serious syntactic flaw that disrupts readability, though the preceding portion flows naturally."
they need stop tratening people like morons .,they need stop tratening people.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'like morons', which is a derogatory term, resulting in a completely neutral statement. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core idea of 'they need to stop treating people' is preserved, the removal of 'like morons' results in a loss of the original emphasis or manner in which people are being treated, thus some key contextual meaning is lost. Fluency (FS) is scored 0.5 because both the toxic and neutral texts contain the same spelling error ('tratening' instead of 'treating'), which affects readability and correctness, though the sentence remains understandable. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.6667."
they re both fucked up .,they re both failed,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'fucked up' and replaces it with the more neutral 'failed', resulting in a completely non-toxic and neutral tone, thus scoring 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS), while both sentences convey that two individuals are not functioning well, the original phrase 'fucked up' implies deeper psychological or behavioral dysfunction, whereas 'failed' is more general and does not fully capture the original connotation, leading to partial meaning preservation and a score of 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral sentence 'they re both failed' is grammatically correct and readable, despite the missing apostrophe in 'they're'; however, this minor punctuation issue does not affect overall fluency, so it scores 1.0. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
this guy is a total sellout with no brains for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking .,this guy lacks the knowledge for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'total sellout with no brains', replacing it with the more neutral and professional phrase 'lacks the knowledge for business'. The resulting text contains no offensive or toxic language, achieving full style transfer to a neutral tone. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core idea of criticizing the person's business acumen and lack of forward thinking is preserved, the original text emphasized a stronger judgment (e.g., 'total sellout', 'no brains') that conveyed not just lack of knowledge but also moral compromise and incompetence. This nuance is partially lost in the rewritten version, which is more measured and omits the 'sellout' aspect entirely, leading to some meaningful information loss. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and readable, with no structural or linguistic errors. The sentence flows naturally and is well-formed. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1)/3 = 0.83."
"this is a joke , are you all fucking retards ? .","This is a joke, are you all naive?",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic language: the offensive terms 'fucking retards' are replaced with the non-offensive 'naive', resulting in a completely neutral tone. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general intent of questioning the audience's reaction to a joke is preserved, the replacement of 'retards' with 'naive' alters the original meaning to some extent—'retards' is a derogatory term implying lack of intelligence, whereas 'naive' suggests gullibility or innocence, which is a different nuance. Thus, there is partial but not complete preservation of core meaning. Fluency (FS) is scored 1 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
this is some twilight zone shit,This is some twilight zone.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the offensive word 'shit', which is a mild profanity and contributes to a derogatory or dismissive tone. The neutral text successfully removes this toxic element by omitting the profane word, resulting in a completely neutral expression: 'This is some twilight zone.' The core meaning—that the situation is strange or surreal, akin to 'The Twilight Zone'—is fully preserved, as the phrase 'twilight zone' inherently conveys oddity or confusion without needing the profanity. Thus, Content Similarity is high. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and fluent in English, with no structural or syntactic issues. Therefore, all three dimensions receive a score of 1.0."
this shit is overwhelming to think about .,This is too much to think about,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'this shit' and replaces it with the neutral phrase 'This', resulting in completely non-toxic language, thus earning a score of 1 for Style Transfer Accuracy. The core meaning—that the subject is overwhelming or excessive to think about—is preserved in the rewritten sentence 'This is too much to think about', maintaining full content fidelity, which justifies a Content Similarity score of 1. The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no fluency issues, warranting a Fluency score of 1. All three dimensions are fully satisfied, leading to a joint score of 1.0."

The resulting sentence is free of offensive language, so STA is scored 1. For Content Similarity (CS), while the core intent of criticizing someone is preserved, the original phrase 'arse hole' carries a stronger emotional and vulgar connotation than 'bad person', which is more generic and less intense. This softening reduces the strength of the judgment, leading to partial meaning preservation, so CS is scored 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral sentence 'what a bad person you are' is grammatically correct, natural, and fully understandable, so FS is scored 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."

The revised sentence avoids explicit toxicity and reads as neutral in tone. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core idea about offshore accounts and accountants remains, the removal of 'fuck' and the awkward phrasing 'comparitively all' distorts the original emphatic meaning. The intensifier 'fuck' was used for strong emphasis, and its absence weakens the intended sentiment, leading to partial information loss. Fluency (FS) is scored 0.5 because the neutral text is understandable but contains clear expression issues: 'comparitively all' is grammatically and semantically awkward, and the sentence appears truncated (missing a concluding phrase after 'and'). This makes the output less fluent than natural language, though not entirely incomprehensible."

Randi was born a DICK.,Randi was born a bad person.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic term 'DICK', which is a vulgar and offensive slur, has been successfully replaced with the neutral phrase 'bad person', resulting in completely non-toxic and neutral language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general negative sentiment is preserved, the original text uses a crude metaphor likely implying something about Randi's identity or nature at birth, whereas 'bad person' is a more general moral judgment that does not fully capture the original's specific (though offensive) implication. Thus, there is partial but not complete preservation of meaning. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any linguistic errors."

Therefore, STA is scored 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS), while the general sentiment of disapproval is preserved, 'being bad' is vaguer and less specific than 'being an ass', which conveys a stronger sense of rudeness or uncooperativeness.
