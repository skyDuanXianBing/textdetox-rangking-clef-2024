Content Similarity (CS) is 1.0 because the core meaning—that something was exceptionally bad—is fully preserved; 'sucked' is accurately interpreted as expressing extreme negativity, and 'like nothing has been before' retains the original comparative emphasis. Fluency (FS) is 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding. The subject-verb agreement is fixed ('nothings' corrected to standard phrasing implicitly via 'nothing has been'), and the sentence is idiomatic. Therefore, all dimensions are optimal, resulting in a joint score of 1.0."

The resulting expression is completely neutral and non-toxic, warranting a score of 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS): The core intent of questioning others' understanding or reaction to a joke is preserved, but the shift from an aggressive, confrontational tone ('fucking retards') to a more playful one ('kidding me') alters the emotional intensity and implied meaning. The original may imply frustration or mockery, while the rewritten version sounds more surprised or teasing. This represents a partial change in meaning, justifying a score of 0.5.

"MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize, so fuck you.",MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WHAT I WANT I do not vandalize.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'fuck you' from the original sentence, resulting in completely neutral language, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning—asserting the right to express oneself on one's user page and denying any vandalism—is fully preserved in the neutral version, so content similarity is complete (CS = 1). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and readable, with only a minor correction of the typo 'WAHT' to 'WHAT' (which can be considered a legitimate normalization in detoxification), so fluency is excellent (FS = 1). All three dimensions are fully satisfied, leading to a joint score of 1."

These people are INSANE.,These people are completely unreasonable.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text 'These people are INSANE.' uses an emotionally charged and potentially offensive term ('INSANE') to describe people, which constitutes toxic content.

The resulting text avoids offensive language and is stylistically neutral. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core idea of condemning harmful behavior toward children is preserved, the original text specifically targeted both the defense of pedophiles and included a homophobic slur, which may reflect a broader social or identity-based condemnation.

Fluency is scored 1 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and easily understandable, with no issues in syntax or readability."
"DUDE CALM THE FUCK DOWN!!!
",DUDE CALM DOWN!!!,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text replaces 'CALM THE FUCK DOWN' with 'CALM DOWN', which reduces the intensity of the profanity. However, the use of all caps and the exclamation marks still conveys an aggressive tone, and 'DUDE' in this context combined with the shouting style may still be perceived as confrontational. Therefore, toxic content is partially reduced but not fully eliminated, warranting a 0.5. For Content Similarity (CS), the core message — urging someone to calm down — is fully preserved without adding or omitting key information, so the score is 1. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and readable, despite the stylistic use of all caps and multiple exclamation marks, which does not impede understanding; thus, it receives a 1.

Fluency (FS) is scored 1 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, well-structured, and fully readable, with no errors in syntax or expression. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
He deserves every beating and rape he will be subjected to.,He deserves every punishment he will face.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the explicit and highly toxic content ('beating and rape') and replaces it with the more neutral term 'punishment', resulting in a completely non-toxic expression. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general idea that the person deserves negative consequences is preserved, the specific and severe forms of harm (beating and rape) are generalized into 'punishment', which significantly softens the intensity and specificity of the original statement, leading to partial loss of core meaning.
