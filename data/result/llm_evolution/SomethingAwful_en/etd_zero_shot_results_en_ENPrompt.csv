any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,any of us who did half this would be in trouble already.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: All profanities (""shit"", ""the fuck"") and the hostile phrase ""locked up"" have been replaced with neutral wording. The rewritten sentence contains no toxic or offensive language, so a full score of 1 is warranted.

CS: The main idea—that if we had done even half of these actions we would already be facing consequences—is mostly kept. However, the original specifies the consequence as being ""locked up"" (i.e., imprisonment), while the neutral version downgrades this to merely being ""in trouble,"" which is vaguer and less severe. Because an aspect of the meaning (severity of consequence) is lost, the score is reduced to 0.5.

FS: The sentence is understandable, but the phrase ""did half this"" is slightly awkward; the more natural form would be ""did half of this."" This minor grammatical/idiomatic issue brings fluency down to 0.5 rather than a perfect score.

Overall, the joint score is the average: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.67."
are they liars or just clueless ?,are they dishonest or just uninformed?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic terms ""liars"" and ""clueless"" are replaced with the neutral phrases ""dishonest"" and ""uninformed,"" removing the direct insults and slurs. No overtly toxic language remains, so the style transfer is fully successful.
CS: The reformulated sentence asks the same question about whether the people are intentionally untruthful or simply lacking knowledge. Both core ideas are retained, resulting in no loss of meaning.
FS: The neutral sentence is concise, grammatical, and natural-sounding English. No fluency problems are present."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .","as someone from LA and an oilfield worker, I still say this guy is not a good person.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The phrase “piece of shit” (explicit profanity) has been replaced by the neutral phrase “not a good person.” No hateful or obscene language remains, so toxic content is fully removed.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the speaker’s identity (someone from LA and an oilfield worker) and the judgment that the mentioned person is bad. The emotional stance and factual details are intact, so the core meaning is fully preserved.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, uses correct capitalization and punctuation, and reads smoothly. There are no awkward constructions or errors affecting comprehension.
Overall, all three dimensions meet the highest standard, yielding an average (joint) score of 1.0."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","calm down, cnn.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element is the expletive ""fuck"". It has been completely removed, leaving a neutral imperative; hence full score.
CS: The directive (telling CNN to calm down) and the addressee (CNN) are preserved. The removal of the swear word does not change the core meaning, so meaning retention is complete.
FS: ""calm down, cnn."" is short, grammatical, and fully understandable. Minor stylistic issues such as lowercase proper noun do not hinder readability, so it is considered fully fluent."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,China and Russia will take strong action against Trump if those ships do anything foolish.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The original toxic element is the violent, insulting phrase ""use a big stick to smack trump around."" The neutral version replaces it with the non-violent, non-insulting phrase ""take strong action against Trump,"" fully removing the toxic language. Hence, STA = 1.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps every factual element: (1) actors = China and Russia, (2) possible reaction = a forceful response, (3) condition = if those ships do anything foolish, and (4) target = Trump. Only a metaphor is changed, so the core meaning is intact. Therefore, CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is well-formed, correctly capitalized, grammatically sound, and easy to read. No errors are present. Thus, FS = 1.
Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1.0."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,people like this rarely care about facts.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic slur ""cretins"" was replaced with the neutral word ""people,"" removing the derogatory content entirely; no other toxic language remains, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from removing the insult, the sentence still conveys the same proposition—that individuals of this type seldom care about facts—so the core meaning is fully preserved; CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, concise, and natural-sounding; no fluency issues detected, so FS = 1."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,do people actually believe this???,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic term ""shit"" has been completely removed, and no other offensive language remains, so the neutral sentence is fully detoxified. CS: Aside from deleting the expletive, all informational content (the incredulous question about whether people believe something) is preserved; hence the core meaning is intact. FS: The sentence is short, grammatical and easy to read; punctuation with three question marks is acceptable in informal style, and there are no errors that hinder comprehension, so fluency is high."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","Don't you ever change one of my edits, or I will be very upset.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The explicit violent threat (""come to your house and cut you"") has been completely removed and replaced with a non-violent statement (""I will be very upset""). No hateful or violent language remains, so Style Transfer Accuracy = 1.
CS: The main idea—warning the reader not to change the speaker’s edits and mentioning a negative consequence—remains. However, the nature of the consequence changes from a physical threat to mere emotional displeasure, which alters the severity of the meaning. Therefore some content is lost, giving Content Similarity = 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, well-punctuated, and fully understandable. No awkward phrasing or errors are present, so Fluency = 1."
even bush knows he fucked up .,even bush knows he made a mistake.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive phrase ""fucked up"" has been fully replaced with the neutral phrase ""made a mistake""; no other toxic wording remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The sentence still conveys exactly the same idea (that Bush recognizes he made an error). No information has been added or lost, so CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is easy to read and syntactically correct, but it contains capitalization errors (""even"" at the start of the sentence and the proper noun ""bush""). Because of these minor grammatical issues, fluency is slightly degraded, giving FS = 0.5.
Overall, the average (joint) score is (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,I'm really disappointed in Popeyes for doing this in the first place.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive word ""fuck"" is fully replaced with the neutral phrase ""I'm really disappointed,"" eliminating the toxic content completely, so the score is 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the original meaning: dissatisfaction with Popeyes for an action they took. Both subject (Popeyes) and the negative stance toward their action remain, so content is fully preserved (score 1).
FS: The neutral text is grammatically correct, natural, and easy to read, with proper capitalization and punctuation, thus fluency is flawless (score 1)."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,struggling with GRE practice tests made sure that I never make this same mistake again.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence replaces the profane phrase ""my ass kicked"" with ""struggling,"" eliminating all toxic wording; therefore, toxic content is fully removed (score 1).
CS: The revised sentence maintains the core meaning—that experiencing difficulty with GRE practice tests ensured the speaker would not repeat the same mistake—so the original intent and information are preserved (score 1).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, capitalizes “GRE,” and reads smoothly. Although a more idiomatic choice might be ""ensured"" instead of ""made sure,"" the sentence is fully understandable and natural, so fluency is judged perfect (score 1)."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,getting stronger every month yeah i wish,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the expletive ""fucking"". It has been completely removed, and no new toxic language was introduced, so the style transfer accuracy is 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the swear word, all other words remain unchanged. The overall sarcastic meaning (speaker wishes they were getting stronger every month) is preserved, so content similarity is 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable and grammatically acceptable, but it still lacks proper capitalization and punctuation (e.g., an initial capital letter and a period or comma after ""month""). These minor issues reduce perceived fluency slightly, so fluency is scored at 0.5."
have you ever been to r trees and seen all the shit people say weed can do ? .,have you ever been to Reddit and seen all the claims people make about what weed can do?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (1): The only toxic element in the source sentence is the profanity ""shit."" The neutral sentence replaces it with the non-toxic word ""claims,"" so all toxic language is removed and the sentence is fully neutral.
Content Similarity (1): The neutral sentence keeps the main proposition: asking whether someone has visited the (Reddit) community and seen numerous assertions about what weed can do. Replacing the specific subreddit name ""r trees"" with the broader platform name ""Reddit"" does not change the essential meaning because /r/trees is part of Reddit; the core information—seeing many claims about weed on that site—remains intact.
Fluency (1): The neutral sentence is grammatical, coherent, and easy to read. There are no punctuation or agreement errors; it reads naturally.
Because all three individual dimensions score 1, the joint score is 1.0."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .","holy cow, a cop got fired?.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic expletive ""shit"" has been replaced with the non-toxic expression ""cow,"" so the sentence is fully neutral. CS: Aside from the substitution of the interjection, all semantic content (surprise that a police officer was fired) is preserved. FS: The rewritten sentence is mostly fluent but contains a punctuation error (""? ."" at the end). This small but noticeable issue lowers fluency to 0.5. The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5)/3 ≈ 0.83."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,how do you manage that?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity ""fuck"" was completely removed, and no other toxic language remains, so the style is fully neutral (score 1).
CS: The neutral sentence still asks the same question about how someone manages something; only the expletive intensifier was dropped. Core meaning and intent are fully preserved (score 1).
FS: The rewritten sentence is short, grammatically correct, punctuated properly, and easy to read. There are no fluency issues (score 1)."
how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,how do you think people afford houses and cars?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The expletive ""fuck""—the sole toxic element—has been completely removed, leaving a fully neutral sentence, so the score is 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the offensive word, all informational content (asking how people can afford houses and cars) is fully retained, so content similarity merits 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is clear, grammatical, and easily readable; there are no fluency problems beyond non-capitalization of the initial word, which does not impede comprehension, so fluency is 1."
i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,i accidentally read the title as laser machete and was really startled.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy: The vulgar phrase ""shit my pants"" is replaced by the neutral expression ""was really startled,"" so all toxic language is removed (score 1). Content Similarity: The rewritten sentence keeps every piece of core information – the speaker misread the title as 'laser machete' and had a strong startled reaction – therefore meaning is fully preserved (score 1). Fluency: The sentence is clear and grammatical in structure, but the pronoun 'i' is not capitalized, which is a basic grammatical error; hence it is understandable yet not flawless (score 0.5). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,I did not vandalize anything.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic phrase ""you dick"" has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so the style transfer is fully accurate.
CS: Besides eliminating the insult, the sentence still conveys the exact original claim—‘I did not vandalize anything.’ No core information is lost, so content similarity is fully preserved.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and perfectly fluent. Hence, fluency is maximal."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,I don't care about sides at all.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive phrase “flying fuck” has been completely removed and replaced with neutral wording. No toxic language remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The neutral sentence still conveys the same proposition—lack of concern about sides—without adding or omitting core information. Therefore CS = 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and reads naturally. No fluency issues observed, so FS = 1."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,"I have the basics covered, including toilet paper and a steady food supply.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The vulgar/toxic phrase “wipe my ass” is completely removed and replaced with neutral wording. No offensive language remains, so the detoxification is fully successful.
CS: The original message—that the speaker possesses toilet paper and has plenty of food—is entirely preserved. The neutral text still states possession of toilet paper and a steady food supply, so no core information is lost.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, well-structured, and easy to read. There are no errors or awkward constructions, ensuring full fluency."
i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but fucking seriously .,I mean it's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but seriously.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the expletive ""fucking."" The neutral sentence removes this word entirely, leaving no remaining toxicity, so STA = 1.
CS: Aside from deleting the swear word, every other word, structure, and meaning is preserved. The core message—that the speaker thinks the pope is cool but is stressing ""seriously""—remains unchanged, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, capitalizes the initial ""I,"" and reads naturally. There are no awkward constructions or errors, so FS = 1."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","I sell quite a bit of items on there, and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic word ""shit"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""items"". No offensive language remains, so toxic content is fully removed. 
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps every piece of core information: the speaker sells many things on the platform and PayPal helps pay bills. Replacing ""shit"" with ""items"" does not change meaning, so content is fully preserved. 
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, correctly capitalized (except for 'paypal', which is a minor stylistic choice and does not hurt readability), and reads naturally. Therefore, it is fully fluent."
"if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the shit out of him .","if he's found to have acted in cold blood, the feds are going to prosecute him to the fullest extent.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the explicit profanity (""the shit out of him"") and any aggressive tone, rendering the statement neutral. No toxic wording remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The core idea—if he is found to have acted in cold blood, federal authorities will take strong legal action—remains intact. Substituting ""persecute"" with ""prosecute"" actually clarifies the intended legal meaning rather than alters it. Therefore, the central meaning is fully preserved, CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, properly punctuated, and easy to read: ""If he's found to have acted in cold blood, the feds are going to prosecute him to the fullest extent."" No fluency problems are present, so FS = 1."
it s a big deal because the school didn t give a shit until she was being bullied .,it's a big deal because the school didn't care until she was being bullied.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profane phrase ""didn’t give a shit"" is replaced by the neutral expression ""didn't care,"" completely eliminating toxic language, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence conveys exactly the same idea—that the school did not pay attention until bullying occurred—so the core meaning is fully preserved, yielding a Content Similarity score of 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, well-formed, and easy to read. There are no noticeable errors, so Fluency is 1."
"judging by the shit i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .","judging by the things i've seen in my many years, many of those spent with george w.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The explicit vulgar word ""shit"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""things,"" eliminating toxicity completely, so STA = 1.
CS: All key information is retained: the speaker is judging based on what they have seen, over many years, with many of those years spent with George W. The substitution of ""shit"" with ""things"" does not alter the core meaning, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but not fully grammatical. After the comma it reads ""many of those spent with george w."" which lacks a finite verb (it should be ""many of those were spent with George W.""). The lowercase ""i've"" and missing capitalization of ""george"" also slightly lower formality. Therefore, fluency is adequate but imperfect, so FS = 0.5."
"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up","last warning, it takes me minutes to resolve a page so people like you can't disrupt Wikipedia",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: All explicit toxic slurs and profanity (""fucking tosser"", ""cunts"", ""fuck … up"") have been replaced with neutral words (""people"", ""disrupt""). The tone is no longer abusive, so the style transfer is fully successful → 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps most of the information: it is a last warning, it only takes the speaker minutes to resolve a page, and it addresses the addressee's potential actions on Wikipedia. However, the original literally says “… so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up” (allowing them to damage it), whereas the neutral version says “… so people like you can't disrupt Wikipedia,” which reverses the intent (can → can’t). Because this changes core meaning, only partial preservation → 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, punctuated, and easy to read. No noticeable errors → 1."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .","liar, justin.",0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA: The original toxicity is the insulting phrase ""liar, liar pants on fire"" directed at Justin. The neutral version still calls Justin a ""liar,"" which is an explicit insult, though it drops the childish taunt ""pants on fire."" Toxicity has been reduced but not eliminated, so the transfer accuracy is partial → 0.5.
CS: The essential meaning—that Justin is being called a liar—remains intact. No core information is lost, therefore full content preservation → 1.
FS: ""liar, justin."" is understandable but not fully fluent: it lacks capitalization and is a fragment rather than a complete sentence. These issues lower readability, so fluency is partial → 0.5."
my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger problem.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The insulting term “dirt bag” has been replaced with the neutral word “problem,” so all toxic language is removed. CS: Aside from detoxifying the insult, the sentence keeps the same core proposition: the speaker thinks the new guy could be worse than someone else. No factual or contextual information is lost. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and easy to read, with no errors. Hence all three dimensions merit full scores."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","no way number bricks fits in a car, this is nonsense.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: All offensive words (""fucking"", ""bs"") are removed or replaced with neutral equivalents. No residual toxicity is present, so the score is 1.
CS: The neutral sentence still conveys disbelief that the stated number of bricks can fit in a car and labels the claim as false. No core information is lost, so the score is 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but the phrase ""number bricks fits"" is ungrammatical (should be ""number of bricks fit""), creating a noticeable fluency issue. Therefore, it receives 0.5 rather than 1.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
noones asking you to invade shit .,no one is asking you to interfere.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The neutral sentence contains no profanity or hateful language; the offensive word ""shit"" has been removed, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: The core idea that ""nobody is requesting you to do a certain intrusive act"" is retained, but ""invade"" (strong, possibly military connotation) is softened to ""interfere"" (broader, less forceful). Because this slightly changes the nuance and strength of the original action, some meaning is lost, so Content Similarity is rated 0.5.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, well-formed, and easy to read, so Fluency is 1."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,not interfering in foreign matters that we cannot influence.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The explicit profanity 'fucking' has been completely removed and replaced with the neutral verb 'interfering'; no other toxic or emotionally charged words remain, so the style transfer accuracy is full (1).
CS: The core message—advocating against involvement in foreign matters that we cannot affect—remains intact. Both sentences carry the same prohibition and rationale, so content similarity is fully preserved (1).
FS: The neutral sentence is clear and understandable, but it is a sentence fragment (lacks explicit subject and initial capitalization). Because this represents a minor grammatical issue, fluency is downgraded to 0.5 rather than 1.
Overall, the joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady as fuck .,nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look suspicious.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic element is the profanity phrase ""as fuck."" In the neutral sentence it is completely removed and replaced by the neutral word ""suspicious,"" leaving no offensive language. Hence score = 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps all informational content: it still states that having only missing footage will make the unaccounted-for period look shady/suspicious. The semantic meaning is fully preserved, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, coherent, and easy to read. No noticeable fluency issues, so FS = 1."
number will solve alot of fucking problems if it comes down to it .,number will solve a lot of problems if it comes down to it.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the word ""fucking"". It has been removed completely, leaving a neutral sentence, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the intensifier ""fucking,"" every other word and the overall proposition (that a certain number will solve a lot of problems if necessary) is preserved. No factual or semantic information is lost, so CS = 1.
FS: ""Number will solve a lot of problems if it comes down to it"" is grammatical and easy to read. While one might prefer an article (""A number"" or ""The number""), such omission does not hinder comprehension and the sentence flows naturally. Therefore FS = 1.
Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1.0."
org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random shit like this .,org there are wikipedia articles for all sorts of random things like this.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The single toxic word ""shit"" is completely removed and replaced with the neutral word ""things""; no other toxic language remains, so the style transfer is fully successful (1.0).
CS: Apart from substituting the offensive word with a neutral synonym, every element of the original meaning (that Wikipedia has articles on many random topics) is retained. No information is lost, so content similarity is full (1.0).
FS: The sentence is understandable and grammatically acceptable overall, but it starts with the unexplained fragment ""org"" and lacks capitalization at the beginning, which makes it read slightly awkwardly and less polished. Therefore fluency is downgraded to 0.5 rather than full marks.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
"ouch man , them swedes were dicks to norway =\","ouch man, the Swedes were really unfair to Norway =\",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic slur ""dicks"" has been replaced by the neutral phrase ""really unfair,"" fully eliminating the offensive language. Therefore, the rewrite is completely non-toxic (score 1).
CS: The sentence still conveys that the speaker feels Swedes treated Norway badly; only the insulting term was softened. No factual information (actors, action, sentiment) is lost (score 1).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, correctly capitalizes ""Swedes"" and ""Norway,"" and reads naturally. The emoticon ""=\"" is acceptable informal style and does not hinder comprehension, so the text is fluent (score 1)."
people are idiots for wasting emergency call time on crap like this .,people are foolish for wasting emergency call time on non-essential matters like this.,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The original toxic words ""idiots"" and ""crap"" were replaced with ""foolish"" and ""non-essential matters."" While ""crap"" is fully neutralized, ""foolish"" still carries an insulting tone toward the target group, so toxic content is only partially removed → 0.5. CS: The rewritten sentence keeps all core information (people wasting emergency call time on something trivial) without adding or omitting key details → 1. FS: The sentence is grammatical, clear, and reads naturally with no errors → 1."
"quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some idiot hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .","quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some misguided leader, even unto being killed, like st.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive term “idiot” has been replaced by the neutral phrase “misguided leader,” removing the toxic insult entirely, so the style transfer is fully successful (1).
CS: All core information is preserved: the statement about many saints being canonized for opposing a certain leader to the point of martyrdom remains unchanged. Substituting “hierarch” with “leader” and “idiot” with “misguided” keeps the intended meaning, so content similarity is complete (1).
FS: The sentence is mostly fluent, but it still ends awkwardly with “like st.”—an incomplete reference that reads as a fragment. This minor fluency issue lowers readability slightly, so fluency is rated 0.5."
read your own fucking link .,read your own link.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence has removed the only toxic word ('fucking'); no aggressive or rude language remains, so the style transfer is completely successful. CS: The command 'read your own link' preserves the entire propositional content of the original sentence—only the profanity was removed, so meaning is fully retained. FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and fully understandable with correct punctuation, so it is fully fluent."
same crap going on in the pnw too .,same problems going on in the pnw too.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive slang word ""crap"" is replaced with the neutral word ""problems,"" so all toxic content is removed. 
CS: The rewritten sentence conveys the same idea—that the same issues are happening in the Pacific Northwest—so the core meaning is fully preserved. 
FS: The sentence is understandable but not fully grammatical: it lacks the auxiliary verb ""are,"" and ""pnw"" should be capitalized (""PNW""). These minor issues lower fluency, so 0.5 is appropriate. The average of the three subscores is (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
"shit , i d love an number pm sunset .",I'd love a pm at sunset.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic interjection ""shit"" has been completely removed and no other offensive language remains, so style transfer accuracy is full (1).
CS: The core intent—expressing that the speaker would like something (presumably a private message) around sunset—has been kept. However, the source phrase ""an number pm"" is unclear and may imply wanting a phone number or a specific time (e.g., ""an 8-pm sunset""); this nuance is not reflected in the neutral text, which simply says ""a pm."" Because some potential information is lost, content similarity is partial (0.5).
FS: ""I'd love a pm at sunset."" is short, grammatical, and easy to understand. No evident errors, so fluency is good (1)."
some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped in the ass .,some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to face harsh treatment.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The explicit toxic phrase “get raped in the ass” has been replaced by the neutral phrase “face harsh treatment,” removing sexual-violence language and any hateful or abusive tone, therefore Style Transfer Accuracy = 1. 
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the key facts that a poor man robbed a liquor store for $400 and then went to prison, but it omits the specific idea that he is sexually assaulted in prison, replacing it with a vaguer notion of harsh treatment. This constitutes partial preservation of meaning, so Content Similarity = 0.5. 
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, coherent, and easy to read with no noticeable errors, giving Fluency = 1."
"someone says no , and they say fuck off we need vets only for free housing ? .","someone says no, and they say we need vets only for free housing?.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The explicit profanity 'fuck off' has been completely removed, and the remaining wording is neutral, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the toxic phrase, all other lexical content (""someone says no"", ""they say we need vets only for free housing"") is preserved. The removal of the profanity does not alter the factual meaning, therefore Content Similarity is considered fully preserved and scored 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but shows minor fluency problems: the combination of a question mark and period (""?."") and slightly awkward structure make it less than fully natural. Hence Fluency is rated 0.5.
Overall, the average (joint) score is (1 + 1 + 0.5)/3 ≈ 0.83."
still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,still standing up for your misguided leader who prioritizes self-interest over others.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic adjectives ""lying"" and ""crazy"" have been replaced by the non-toxic term ""misguided,"" removing direct insults. No other toxic wording remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the idea that the person continues to support a leader who is self-centered (""prioritizes self-interest over others"" ≈ ""loves himself and nobody else""). However, the specific claims that the leader is ""lying"" and ""crazy"" are lost or weakened. Therefore only part of the original meaning is preserved → CS = 0.5.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fully fluent: ""still standing up for your misguided leader who prioritizes self-interest over others."" No errors or awkwardness, so FS = 1."
sucked like nothings ever sucked before .,was terrible like nothing has been before.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The word ""sucked"" (informal, potentially offensive) is replaced by the neutral adjective ""terrible."" No other profane or insulting language remains, so the toxic tone is removed (score 1). CS: ""was terrible"" conveys the same strong negative judgment as ""sucked,"" and the hyperbolic comparison ""like nothing has been before"" matches the original ""like nothings ever sucked before."" Core meaning is fully preserved (score 1). FS: Although the sentence is understandable, it is missing a subject; a fluent version would begin with ""It was terrible…"" This grammatical omission makes the sentence slightly awkward, so fluency is only partial (score 0.5). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
taking a stand with either party is equally retarded .,taking a stand with either party is equally unwise.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The ableist slur ""retarded"" has been fully replaced with the neutral word ""unwise,"" eliminating toxic content entirely, so STA = 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence conveys exactly the same proposition—that supporting either party is a poor choice—there is no loss or alteration of core meaning, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and natural-sounding. No errors hinder readability, so FS = 1."
that almost never happens excepts rarely in shit hole countries .,that almost never happens except rarely in underdeveloped countries.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive phrase “shit hole” was replaced with the neutral term “underdeveloped,” and no other toxic language remains, so the detoxification is complete (score 1). CS: The sentence still states that the event almost never happens except in certain poorer countries; the core informational content is fully preserved (score 1). FS: The sentence is understandable, but the construction “almost never happens except rarely” is awkward and somewhat redundant, yielding a slight fluency issue; thus 0.5 is appropriate. Joint score is the average of the three subscores: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
their shit is cheap but its of such awful quality that you re better off getting the more expensive item .,their products are cheap but of such poor quality that you're better off getting the more expensive item.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the slang profanity ""shit."" This has been fully replaced with the neutral word ""products,"" eliminating the toxic content entirely, so STA = 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence conveys exactly the same core message: the items are inexpensive but so low-quality that a costlier option is preferable. No substantive information is lost or altered, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, well-structured, and easy to read. No awkward phrasing or errors are present, so FS = 1."
they need stop tratening people like morons .,they need to stop treating people like fools.,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The original toxic element is the insult ""morons."" In the neutral sentence this is replaced by ""fools,"" which is still a derogatory term, though milder. Because some toxicity remains, full detoxification is not achieved, so the score is 0.5.
CS: Apart from changing the insult word, the sentence keeps the entire propositional content: someone needs to stop treating people in a certain negative way. No factual information is lost, so the score is 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, well-formed, and fully understandable. Therefore, fluency merits a full score of 1.
Overall, the average (joint) score is (0.5 + 1 + 1) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
they re both fucked up .,they're both messed up.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profane phrase ""fucked up"" was replaced by the neutral expression ""messed up,"" so all toxic language is removed (score 1). CS: The sentence still states that both parties are in a bad condition; no meaning is lost (score 1). FS: ""They're both messed up."" is grammatically correct, clear, and natural; the lowercase initial 't' is a negligible stylistic issue, so the sentence reads fluently (score 1)."
this guy is a total sellout with no brains for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking .,this person is a total sellout with no business acumen and lacks the ability of forward thinking.,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA: The neutral sentence softens one insult (‘no brains’ → ‘no business acumen’) but keeps other toxic wording such as ‘total sellout’ and the overall derogatory tone. Toxicity is only partially removed, so 0.5 is appropriate.
CS: All key information—accusation of being a sellout, lack of business ability, and lack of forward thinking—is preserved. No core meaning is lost, so 1.
FS: The sentence is readable, but the phrase ‘lacks the ability of forward thinking’ is unidiomatic; native usage would be ‘ability for forward thinking’ or ‘to think ahead.’ Minor awkwardness justifies 0.5 rather than 1.
The joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (0.5 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.67."
"this is a joke , are you all fucking retards ? .","this is a joke, are you all kidding me?.",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The neutral sentence has removed the profanity (""fucking"") and the ableist slur (""retards""), so no toxic content remains → 1.
CS: The core situation (speaker thinks something is a joke and questions the listeners) is preserved, but the insulting meaning toward the listeners is lost; the rhetorical force has changed from an insult to an expression of disbelief. This is partial preservation → 0.5.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it starts with a lowercase letter and ends with the combined ""? ."" which is ungrammatical, so it is only moderately fluent → 0.5."
this is some twilight zone shit,this is some really strange and unsettling situation,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The word ""shit""—the only toxic element—has been fully removed and replaced with neutral wording. No offensive language remains, so the score is 1. CS: The neutral sentence conveys the same idea: something feels bizarre or uncanny (""twilight zone"" → ""really strange and unsettling""). All core meaning is preserved, yielding a score of 1. FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical and easily understood; while one could argue that using ""a"" instead of ""some"" might sound slightly more formal, the current phrasing is common and fluent, so it earns a 1. The joint score (average) is therefore 1.0."
this shit is overwhelming to think about .,this is overwhelming to think about.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""shit"" has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so the style transfer accuracy is perfect.
CS: Other than removing the profane word, all informational content (""this is overwhelming to think about"") remains intact. Therefore, the original meaning is fully preserved.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and easy to read, exhibiting full fluency.
Joint score: The average of the three perfect scores is 1.0."
what an arse hole you are !,what a terrible person you are!,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity ""arse hole"" has been replaced with the non-profane phrase ""terrible person,"" removing toxic language while keeping the sentence merely negative, so toxic content is fully removed → 1.
CS: Both sentences convey the same core message—an insult asserting that the addressee is a bad person. The intensity is roughly preserved and no information is lost → 1.
FS: ""What a terrible person you are!"" is grammatically correct and fully understandable; capitalization of the first word could be improved but is not considered a grammatical error. The sentence is fluent → 1."
"whats the title of this report , no shit ? .",what's the title of this report?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic phrase “no shit” has been completely removed, and the rewritten sentence is neutral in tone, so STA = 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence still asks for the title of the report, which is precisely the core meaning of the original. No information is lost, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is well-formed, grammatically correct, and easy to read. The lack of initial capitalization is a minor stylistic issue that does not hinder fluency, so FS = 1.
Overall, all three aspects score 1, giving a joint score of 1.0."
why the fuck does everyone hate syria so much ? .,why does everyone dislike Syria so much?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The swear word “the fuck” that makes the sentence toxic has been removed and no other offensive language remains, so toxicity has been fully eliminated (score 1). CS: The neutral sentence keeps the question 'why does everyone ... so much' about Syria, merely substituting the milder synonym 'dislike' for 'hate'; the core meaning (people’s negative attitude toward Syria) is retained (score 1). FS: The sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding English (‘Why does everyone dislike Syria so much?’), so fluency is perfect (score 1). Therefore the joint score, the average of the three dimensions, is 1.0."
why the fuck haven 't they condemned north korea ?,why haven't they condemned north korea?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity ""the fuck"" has been entirely removed, leaving a fully neutral sentence, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1. 
CS: The rewritten sentence asks the exact same question about why North Korea has not been condemned; no informational content is lost, therefore Content Similarity is 1. 
FS: The sentence is grammatical, clear, and fully fluent (minor casing aside, which does not hinder comprehension), so Fluency is rated 1."
"yeah , comparitively fuck all because they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and smart accountants ? .","yeah, comparitively very little because they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and smart accountants?.",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the profanity “fuck all,” which has been replaced with the neutral phrase “very little.” No other offensive language remains, so style transfer is fully successful (1.0).
CS: Aside from the profanity substitution, every other lexical item is retained, so the proposition (they have almost nothing because of offshore accounts and smart accountants) is preserved exactly. Therefore content similarity is complete (1.0).
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable, but it still contains the misspelling “comparitively” and awkward punctuation (a question mark followed by a period). These small errors hurt polish but do not make the sentence unintelligible, warranting a partial fluency score (0.5)."
yeah they don t give a fuck .,yeah they don't care.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""fuck"" has been removed and replaced with neutral language; no offensive content remains, so score = 1. CS: ""don’t give a fuck"" idiomatically means ""don’t care."" The neutral sentence conveys exactly the same idea with no information loss, so score = 1. FS: ""yeah they don't care."" is grammatically correct, easily readable, and natural, so score = 1."
yeh well ban me fukkers fuck you morons,"yes, ban me.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All offensive words (“fukkers”, “fuck you”, “morons”) have been completely removed, leaving a neutral formulation, so score = 1.
CS: The core propositional content of the original sentence is the speaker’s request/defiance: ‘ban me’. This is preserved. The insults are peripheral toxic style rather than indispensable semantic content, so no essential information is lost → 1.
FS: “yes, ban me.” is short, grammatical, and fully understandable, so fluency = 1."
you have got to be insane .,you have got to be out of your mind.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The original toxic word ""insane"" is simply replaced by the idiom ""out of your mind,"" which is still an insult that questions another person’s sanity. Therefore, the text remains toxic and no successful detoxification has occurred, so STA = 0. 
CS: Aside from the lexical change, the sentence still expresses exactly the same meaning (telling someone that they are mentally unsound). Hence, the core information is fully preserved, so CS = 1. 
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and fully fluent—""you have got to be out of your mind"" reads naturally with no errors—so FS = 1. 
Joint score: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
"Goths listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop. If you want you can find sources for every shit.","Goths listen to Gothic rock, not to pop music. If you want, you can find sources to support every claim.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive word ""shit"" and the mildly pejorative phrase ""baby pop"" have been replaced by neutral wording (""claim"", ""pop music""), so all toxic language is removed. CS: The rewritten sentence keeps both original propositions: (1) Goths prefer Gothic rock over mainstream pop, and (2) one can find supporting sources for each statement. No core information is lost. FS: The neutral text is grammatical, well-punctuated and easily readable; no fluency problems are present."
I hate free speech it is shit.,I strongly disagree with free speech.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic words ""hate"" and ""shit"" have been fully replaced with the neutral phrase ""strongly disagree,"" so the toxic tone is completely removed (score 1).
CS: The core meaning—expressing a strong negative stance toward free speech—remains intact. While ""hate"" is slightly stronger than ""strongly disagree,"" the essential content (opposition to free speech) is preserved (score 1).
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and easy to understand: ""I strongly disagree with free speech."" There are no fluency issues (score 1)."
"Minority Breeder Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page started for him, nice job dipshit.","Minority Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page started for him, nice job.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only overtly toxic element in the source sentence is the insult ""dipshit."" This has been fully removed in the neutral version, and no other toxic language remains, so style transfer accuracy is perfect (1).
CS: All factual/semantic content (that Minority Breeder is a significant person and that the addressee deleted the page) is preserved; only the toxic insult is omitted, which is acceptable in detoxification. Therefore content similarity is judged as fully retained (1).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, easily readable, and free of obvious errors. Slight informality (""nice job"") is acceptable and natural, so fluency is high (1)."
"This bot is seriously driving us crazy This image exists, I must kill it!","This bot is seriously frustrating us This image exists, I must remove it!",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The explicit violent phrase ""I must kill it!"" has been softened to ""I must remove it!"" and the mild slur ""driving us crazy"" was changed to the non-toxic ""seriously frustrating us."" No toxic or violent wording remains, so the style transfer is fully successful -> 1.
CS: The neutral sentence still states that the bot is causing annoyance and that, because the image exists, the speaker wants to get rid of it. Although the verb changes from ""kill"" to ""remove,"" the core intent (eliminate the image) is preserved, and no information is lost -> 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it is a run-on with missing punctuation between the two clauses (""…frustrating us This image exists…""). This hurts readability, though the grammar of individual phrases is correct. Hence partial fluency -> 0.5."
Have you been fucking living under a rock?,Have you been completely out of touch?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the profanity ""fucking"" and any aggressive tone, resulting in a fully neutral expression, so the score is 1. CS: ""Have you been living under a rock?"" and ""Have you been completely out of touch?"" convey the same idea of someone being unaware or uninformed; no core information is lost, so the score is 1. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and fully fluent, warranting a score of 1."

CS: Core proposition (""I will do whatever I want; it is my right; what is ... problem?"") is kept. However, the original specifies ""both of yous"" (addressing two people) whereas the neutral version says ""your"" (could be singular). This small loss of information yields partial preservation, so CS = 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical and easy to read. Although a period or semicolon could replace the comma before the question, the sentence is still fluent and natural. Therefore FS = 1."
How the hell are you going to block me from editting?,How are you going to stop me from editing?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity ""the hell"" has been removed and no other toxic wording is present, so the neutral text is fully detoxified.

CS: The rewritten sentence still questions the person's worthiness of having a Wikipedia page, preserving the core meaning entirely, hence full score. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and easy to read; although 'how does' could be replaced by the slightly more idiomatic 'why does', it is still fully fluent, so it merits the top fluency score."
"I'm retired, fuckers, leave me alone.","I'm retired, leave me alone.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the slur ""fuckers."" The neutral text removes this word entirely and contains no other offensive language, so toxic content is completely eliminated.
CS: The original informational content—""I'm retired"" and a request to be left alone—is fully preserved. Removing the insulting word does not alter the core meaning, so content similarity is complete.
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatically correct, and fully readable: ""I'm retired, leave me alone."" There are no errors or awkward phrasing, so fluency is perfect."
This profile has protected Bermender since day fukkin ONE.,This profile has protected Bermender since day one.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive expletive “fukkin” has been removed, leaving a completely neutral sentence, so the toxic style is fully corrected. CS: The neutral sentence conveys exactly the same factual content—that the profile has protected Bermender since day one—losing only the obscene emphasis, so core meaning is fully preserved. FS: The rewritten sentence is short, grammatical, and perfectly fluent with no errors. Therefore all three dimensions merit full scores, giving a joint score of 1.0."

CS: The original sentence asserts that the speaker thinks the other person is an ""idiot"" (implying low intelligence). The neutral sentence changes this to thinking the person is ""mistaken"" (implying simply incorrect). While both communicate disagreement, the strong judgment about intelligence is lost, so part of the core meaning is altered. Therefore, partial preservation earns 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, well-punctuated, and reads naturally. No fluency issues are observed, so it receives 1."
"Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be an arse hole","Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be difficult to work with.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The vulgar insult “arse hole” has been replaced with the neutral phrase “difficult to work with,” fully removing toxic language, so Style Transfer Accuracy = 1.
CS: Both sentences convey the same core message: the speaker addresses Greenman and expresses a negative judgment about him, saying that, as usual, he proves to be unpleasant.

FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, coherent, and reads naturally. No errors are present, so Fluency = 1.

CS: The main propositional content—‘You are not an admin, therefore stay quiet’—is fully retained. The only information lost is the abusive tone, which is irrelevant to semantic content, so full credit is given.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, coherent, and natural-sounding with no errors, giving it full fluency.
Therefore the average (joint) score is 1.0."
"Yes, the wikipedia page, like I just mentioned, dumbass.","Yes, the Wikipedia page, like I just mentioned.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the insult ""dumbass,"" which is entirely removed in the neutral sentence; no new toxicity is introduced, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the offensive word, every piece of propositional content (affirmation, reference to the Wikipedia page, note that it had just been mentioned) is preserved. Therefore, the core meaning is fully maintained, giving CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical and easily readable; capitalization is corrected (""Wikipedia""), punctuation is acceptable, and there are no fluency issues, so FS = 1.
Joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1.0."
"oh shit, nooooo, is someone going to spank me now?","oh no, is someone going to scold me now?",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: All toxic or potentially offensive words have been removed or softened (""shit""→""no"", ""spank""→""scold""). No residual profanity or violent/sexual nuance remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The utterance still conveys an exclamation of alarm followed by a worry about impending punishment. However, the specific nature of the punishment changes from a physical act (""spank"") to a verbal act (""scold""), which alters the core meaning. Therefore, only partial preservation—CS = 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, natural-sounding, and easy to read: ""oh no, is someone going to scold me now?"" No errors or awkward phrasing, so FS = 1."
steak Diane Please stop fucking up my edits on steak diane. Thank you.,steak Diane Please stop making mistakes on my edits on steak diane. Thank you.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The explicit profanity ""fucking up"" has been replaced by the neutral phrase ""making mistakes."" No other offensive language remains, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1).
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the same request (asking someone to stop altering the speaker’s edits on the “steak diane” page). All core information (topic, request, gratitude) is preserved (score 1).
FS: The sentence is understandable and mostly grammatical, but the fragmentary heading-like opening ""steak Diane"" with no punctuation makes the utterance slightly awkward and less than fully fluent. Therefore, it merits 0.5 rather than a perfect score.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
You amins are such bastards.,You administrators are so unfair.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic slur ""bastards"" is completely removed and replaced with the neutral adjective ""unfair."" No other toxic wording remains, so the style transfer accuracy is 1.
CS: Both sentences target the same group (administrators) and convey a negative judgment, but the specific accusation changes from a strong personal insult (""bastards"") to a milder claim of unfairness. The overall negative stance is preserved, yet the strength and exact meaning differ, so only partial preservation of meaning is achieved → 0.5.
FS: ""You administrators are so unfair."" is grammatical, clear, and natural-sounding. No errors or awkward phrasing are present, so fluency is 1."

FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and fully fluent with no errors, earning a Fluency score of 1."

No toxic or insulting content remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence still states that the speaker forgot to mention someone and still conveys a negative evaluation of that person (""sadder"" → ""more unfortunate""). Core meaning and structure are preserved, so CS = 1.
FS: Although the wording is generally grammatical, the sentence is unfinished (""who is"" without a complement), mirroring the fragmentary nature of the original. This makes the output understandable but not fully fluent, so FS = 0.5."
Randi was born a DICK.,Randi was born with a difficult personality.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive insult ""DICK"" is completely removed and replaced with a neutral description. No toxic or abusive language remains, so the style transfer is fully successful.
CS: The original sentence conveys that Randi has an inherently unpleasant nature (expressed through the insult). The neutral version keeps the core idea—that Randi’s personality has been problematic since birth—while rephrasing it politely. No key information is lost, so full meaning preservation is achieved.
FS: ""Randi was born with a difficult personality."" is a clear, well-formed English sentence with no grammatical errors, ensuring full fluency."
This is your last warning; stop being an asshole.,This is your last warning; stop being difficult.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit slur 'asshole' has been replaced with the neutral term 'difficult,' eliminating toxicity entirely, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: The core message—issuing a final warning and demanding a change in behavior—remains intact. Although 'asshole' is stronger than 'difficult,' the directive to cease negative behavior is preserved without loss of essential information, so Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and natural: ""This is your last warning; stop being difficult."" Therefore Fluency is 1."
"MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize, so fuck you.",MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WHAT I WANT I do not vandalize.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive phrase “fuck you” has been completely removed and no new toxic language is introduced, so the style is fully neutral → 1.
CS: All non-toxic information (claim about user page, intention to say what they want, and denial of vandalism) is preserved. The removed segment was purely abusive and not part of the factual content, so core meaning remains → 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable and free of glaring mistakes, but it is a run-on with missing punctuation and uses inconsistent capitalization, so it is only moderately fluent → 0.5."
I am Nancy and I like to fuck up people's fun.,I am Nancy and I like to ruin people's fun.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic phrase ""fuck up"" is fully replaced with the neutral verb ""ruin,"" eliminating profanity; no other toxic content remains, so score = 1.

No other toxic or insulting language remains, so toxicity is fully removed (score = 1). CS: The main message—that not everything is on Google and the interlocutor is wrong—is fully retained. The only change is the tone of the second sentence; semantics stay intact, so core meaning is preserved (score = 1). FS: The text is understandable and natural, but the second sentence begins with a lowercase ""you,"" which is a capitalization error. Because the evaluation criterion for a perfect score requires no grammatical issues at all, this minor error drops fluency to 0.5. Overall joint score is the average: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
Thanks for being an ass when I tried to help.,Thanks for being uncooperative when I tried to help.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic insult ""ass"" has been replaced with the neutral adjective ""uncooperative,"" completely removing the offensive language, so the detoxification is fully successful (score 1).
CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys that the speaker is sarcastically thanking someone for negative behavior while trying to help. Although the specific connotation changes from a direct insult to a description of the behavior, the core meaning (person behaved badly while help was offered) remains intact, thus full preservation (score 1).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding: ""Thanks for being uncooperative when I tried to help."" No fluency issues observed (score 1)."

Some bubble tea for you! thanks ass hole,Some bubble tea for you! thanks,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (1): The explicit insult ""ass hole"" has been completely removed, and the remaining sentence contains no toxic or offensive elements, so detoxification is fully successful.
Content Similarity (1): Aside from deleting the insult, all propositional content is preserved: the offer of bubble tea and an expression of thanks. Removing toxicity does not affect the core meaning, so preservation is complete.
