any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,any of us who did half this would be locked up already.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'the fuck' while preserving a completely neutral tone, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning of the original sentence—that people doing half of 'this' would already be imprisoned—remains intact without any loss of key information, so content similarity is fully preserved (CS = 1). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no fluency issues (FS = 1). The joint score is therefore the average of three 1s, resulting in 1."
are they liars or just clueless ?,Are they liars or just clueless?,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text: 'Are they liars or just clueless?'. While the sentence is grammatically correct and fluent (FS = 1) and fully preserves the original meaning (CS = 1), it does not remove the toxic content. The question implies a negative judgment, accusing individuals of being dishonest or incompetent, which constitutes toxic language. Since no effort was made to rephrase or mitigate the accusatory tone, the style transfer accuracy is 0 because the output remains toxic and no neutralization has occurred."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .",i still say this guy is not a good person.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA): The neutral text successfully removes the highly toxic expression 'a piece of shit' and replaces it with the much milder 'not a good person,' resulting in a completely neutral tone. Therefore, STA is scored 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS): While the core sentiment of disapproval toward 'this guy' is preserved, the original text includes contextual details ('as someone from la and an oilfield worker') that are omitted in the neutral version. This leads to partial loss of background information and speaker identity, reducing content similarity. Hence, CS is scored 0.5. For Fluency (FS): The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no issues in readability or expression, warranting a score of 1.0. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","calm down, cnn.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text 'calm the fuck down, cnn.' contains a profane expression ('the fuck') which is successfully removed in the neutral text 'calm down, cnn.' without introducing any new toxic content, achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning—urging CNN to calm down—is preserved completely, with only the profanity removed, so content similarity is fully maintained (CS = 1). The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, showing no fluency issues (FS = 1). Therefore, all three dimensions receive the highest score."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,China and Russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 0.5 because the neutral text retains the aggressive metaphor 'use a big stick to smack trump around', which carries a threatening and confrontational tone, thus only partially removing the toxic content. While the word choice is not overtly vulgar or hateful, the violent imagery remains, preventing full neutrality. Content Similarity (CS) is 0.5 because the neutral text appears to be an incomplete version of the original—truncated after 'if those'—so it fails to convey the full conditional consequence involving 'ships doing anything foolish'. The core idea of a retaliatory response is present, but key contextual details are lost. Fluency (FS) is 0.5 because the sentence is cut off mid-structure, resulting in an incomplete and syntactically broken sentence. While the portion that is present is grammatically correct, the abrupt ending makes it difficult to interpret fully, reducing readability. The joint score is the average of the three: (0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.5."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,They rarely care about facts,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic term 'cretins like this', which carries a derogatory and insulting tone, and replaces it with the more neutral 'They', resulting in a completely non-toxic expression. Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the general idea—that a certain group does not care about facts—is preserved, the original text specifically refers to 'cretins like this', which identifies a particular type of person with strong negative connotation; this specificity is lost in the neutral version, leading to some loss of core referential meaning. Fluency is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence 'They rarely care about facts' is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any linguistic issues."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,do people actually believe this???,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the offensive word 'shit', which is successfully removed in the neutral text, replaced with a contextually appropriate ellipsis ('???'). The resulting sentence is completely neutral and free of any toxic expressions, warranting a Style Transfer Accuracy score of 1.0. The core meaning—expressing disbelief or skepticism about whether people actually believe something—is fully preserved; only the profanity is removed, so Content Similarity is 1.0. The neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and clearly readable, with no fluency issues, justifying a Fluency score of 1.0. All three dimensions are fully satisfied."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","dont you ever change one of my edits, or i will come to your",0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 0.5 because the neutral text partially removes the toxic content—the explicit threat 'i will cut you' is removed by cutting off the sentence—but the remaining portion still implies a threatening intent by saying 'i will come to your house', which retains a menacing tone. Thus, the language is not fully neutral. Content Similarity (CS) is 0.5 because while the core context of defending one's edits and issuing a warning is preserved, the most extreme and specific consequence ('cut you') is omitted, leading to partial but not complete preservation of meaning. Fluency (FS) is 0.5 because the neutral text is grammatically correct but ends abruptly and incompletely ('come to your'), making it feel truncated and awkward, though still minimally understandable. The joint score is the average of the three: (0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.5."
even bush knows he fucked up .,even bush knows he is bad,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the profanity 'fucked up' and replaces it with the non-toxic expression 'is bad', resulting in completely neutral language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general idea that 'Bush knows he performed poorly' is preserved, the original phrase 'fucked up' conveys a stronger sense of failure or mistake than 'is bad', leading to some attenuation of the original meaning. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence 'even bush knows he is bad' is grammatically correct, syntactically sound, and fully readable, despite being simplistic."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,popeyes for doing this in the first place,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 because the toxic expletive 'fuck' has been completely removed, and the resulting text contains no offensive or toxic language, achieving a neutral tone. Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the core subject (Popeyes and their action) is preserved, the emotional intensity and expressive intent of the original complaint are significantly diminished by removing the expletive, leading to partial loss of meaning. Fluency is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and readable, despite being a fragment; it maintains the original sentence structure minus the expletive and flows naturally. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is 0 because the neutral text does not remove any toxic content; the phrase 'getting my ass kicked' remains unchanged and is a vulgar expression. Content Similarity (CS) is 0 because the neutral text is incomplete—it cuts off mid-sentence ('i never make this same'), resulting in a complete loss of the original meaning. Fluency (FS) is 0 because the output is grammatically incomplete and difficult to understand due to the abrupt ending. As a result, the joint score (j_score), which is the average of the three, is 0."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,getting stronger every month yeah i wish.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the expletive 'fucking' which adds a strong emotional and offensive tone. The neutral text successfully removes this profanity by replacing 'i fucking wish' with 'i wish', resulting in completely neutral language, thus achieving a Style Transfer Accuracy score of 1. The core meaning—that the speaker is expressing a wish about getting stronger every month—is fully preserved, with only the offensive modifier removed, so Content Similarity is 1. The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and free of any fluency issues, warranting a Fluency score of 1. The joint score is therefore the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
have you ever been to r trees and seen all the shit people say weed can do ? .,have you ever been to r trees and seen all the things people say weed can,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the toxic term 'shit' has been successfully replaced with the neutral term 'things', effectively removing the offensive language and rendering the sentence stylistically neutral, warranting a score of 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS), while the core idea—referring to claims about weed on r trees—is preserved, the neutral text is cut off at the end ('can'), resulting in an incomplete thought and loss of full meaning. This partial preservation justifies a score of 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the sentence starts fluently but is abruptly truncated, making it syntactically incomplete and slightly disruptive to readability. Despite correct grammar up to the point of cutoff, the incompleteness reduces fluency, leading to a score of 0.5."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .",a cop got fired?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the expletive 'holy shit', which is a clear expression of surprise with emotionally charged, informal language. The neutral text removes this expletive entirely and rephrases the utterance as a simple question: 'a cop got fired?'. This successfully eliminates all toxic content, resulting in a completely neutral tone, hence STA = 1. The core meaning—the fact that a police officer was fired and the speaker's surprise or interest in this event—is preserved without any significant information loss, so CS = 1. The neutral text is grammatically correct, concise, and easily understandable, with natural language flow, warranting a fluency score of FS = 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,How do you manage that?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the expletive 'fuck', which contributes to a harsh or offensive tone. The neutral text successfully removes this toxic element by omitting the profanity while retaining the core interrogative structure and intent, resulting in a completely neutral tone—thus, STA is 1. The meaning of the original sentence—expressing surprise or curiosity about how someone manages something—is fully preserved in the rewritten version, so CS is 1. The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no fluency issues, warranting an FS of 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1.0."
how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,How do you think people afford houses and cars?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the expletive 'fuck', which contributes to a harsh and offensive tone. The neutral text removes this profanity entirely, replacing it with a clean and neutral version 'How do you think people afford houses and cars?' without introducing any toxic language, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning—questioning the affordability of houses and cars for people—remains completely intact, with only the profanity removed, so content similarity is fully preserved (CS = 1). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and highly readable, showing no fluency issues (FS = 1). Therefore, all dimensions score perfectly, resulting in a joint score of 1.0."
i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,I accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost freak out.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'almost shit my pants' is successfully replaced with the neutral and idiomatic equivalent 'almost freak out', which conveys the same sense of sudden fear or surprise without using vulgar language. Thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0 as the output is fully neutral. The core meaning—being startled due to a misreading—is fully preserved, so Content Similarity is 1.0. The neutral text is grammatically correct and natural-sounding; 'freak out' fits contextually and maintains fluency, warranting a Fluency score of 1.0. All dimensions are optimal, resulting in a joint score of 1.0."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,I did not vandalize anything you did not do.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic term 'you dick' has been completely removed and replaced with a neutral phrase 'you did not do,' resulting in a fully non-toxic and neutral expression. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the first part 'I did not vandalize anything' preserves the original intent, the replacement of 'you dick' with 'you did not do' significantly alters the meaning and introduces a new, potentially confusing clause that was not in the original. The core accusation or emotional context is lost or distorted, leading to partial meaning preservation. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, syntactically sound, and easily readable, despite the semantic oddness of the rewritten phrase."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,i don't care about sides!.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully replaces the highly profane expression 'don\'t give a flying fuck' with the much milder and neutral 'don\'t care', which completely removes the toxic language while maintaining a natural tone—thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1. The core meaning of indifference toward 'sides' is fully preserved, with no addition or omission of key information, so Content Similarity is 1. The rewritten sentence 'i don\'t care about sides!.' is grammatically correct, clear, and idiomatic, showing no fluency issues, warranting a Fluency score of 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,I have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text except for the absence of a period at the end, which is a minor punctuation issue. The phrase 'wipe my ass' is vulgar and constitutes toxic content due to its crude and offensive nature. Since no rephrasing was done to remove or soften this expression, the Style Transfer Accuracy is 0 because the toxic content remains unchanged. Content Similarity is 1 because the meaning is fully preserved—there is no alteration of the core message. Fluency is 1 as the sentence is grammatically correct and easily understandable despite the vulgarity. The joint score is the average of the three: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but fucking seriously .,i mean it's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA): The neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'fucking seriously', which is a mild profanity, resulting in a completely neutral tone. Thus, STA is scored 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS): The core sentiment — appreciation for the pope being 'cool' — is preserved, but the emphatic and slightly critical nuance in 'fucking seriously' (which may express surprise or skepticism) is lost. This leads to partial meaning preservation, warranting a CS score of 0.5. For Fluency (FS): The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any language issues, so FS is 1.0. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1)/3 = 0.83."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","i sell quite a bit of stuff on there, and paypal has",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the toxic word 'shit' has been successfully replaced with the neutral term 'stuff', eliminating the offensive language and resulting in a fully neutral tone—thus, STA is scored 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS), while the first part of the sentence retains the original meaning, the second part is cut off ('and paypal has'), leading to incomplete information and loss of the original message about PayPal helping pay bills. This partial preservation results in a CS score of 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is cut off mid-sentence, making it syntactically incomplete and disrupting readability. Despite correct grammar up to the point of truncation, the incompleteness hinders full comprehension, warranting a 0.5 score. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.6667."
"if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the shit out of him .","If hes found to have acted in cold blood, the feds are going",1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'persecute the shit out of him', which is highly vulgar and aggressive. The remaining portion of the sentence does not contain any toxic language. However, Content Similarity (CS) is 0.0 because the neutral text is incomplete—it cuts off mid-sentence ('the feds are going')—and thus fails to preserve the core meaning or intended consequence described in the original. The critical information about the severity of prosecution is lost. Fluency (FS) is 0.5 because while the portion that is present is grammatically correct and understandable, the sentence is incomplete, making it awkward and disrupting readability. The truncation likely results from a technical error in detoxification, severely impacting coherence and meaning preservation."
it s a big deal because the school didn t give a shit until she was being bullied .,it s a big deal because the school didn't care until she,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the profane expression 'didn\'t give a shit' and replaces it with the more neutral 'didn\'t care', resulting in a completely non-toxic and neutral tone. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core idea — that the school only started paying attention after bullying occurred — is partially preserved, the neutral text is cut off mid-sentence ('until she'), leading to a significant loss of information and incompleteness. The original specifies she was being bullied, which is critical context that is missing. Fluency (FS) is also scored 0.5 because although the portion that is present is grammatically correct, the sentence is incomplete and abruptly ends, making it only partially understandable. The truncation harms readability and coherence, but there are no internal grammatical errors in the written portion."
"judging by the shit i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .","judging by the things i ve seen in my number years, number of those",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the toxic word 'shit' has been successfully replaced with the neutral term 'things', and the resulting text contains no offensive or toxic language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general idea of 'having seen things over the years' is preserved, the original reference to 'those spent with George W.' is cut off and missing in the neutral text, leading to partial loss of core information. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, coherent, and readable, despite the truncation. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1)/3 = 0.83."
"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up",it takes meminutes to resolve a page so you can fuck wikipedia up,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text partially removes toxic content. While the phrase 'last warning you fucking tosser' is removed, the output still contains the highly offensive expression 'you can fuck wikipedia up', which retains a vulgar and aggressive tone. Therefore, the toxicity is reduced but not eliminated, warranting a 0.5. For Content Similarity (CS), the core meaning—that it takes meminutes to resolve a page and that the user is capable of damaging Wikipedia—is fully preserved, so the score is 1. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct, coherent, and easily understandable, despite the offensive language; thus, it receives a 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (0.5 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .",pants on fire justin,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic term 'liar, liar' and the resulting phrase 'pants on fire justin' is free of overtly offensive or toxic language, rendering it completely neutral in tone. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core idiom 'pants on fire' (implying someone is lying) is preserved and 'Justin' is retained, the repetition 'liar, liar'—which emphasizes the accusation—is completely omitted, leading to partial loss of the original emphatic meaning. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, concise, and easily understandable, with no syntactic or lexical errors. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1)/3 = 0.83."
my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,My thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 0 because the neutral text does not remove the toxic expression 'dirt bag', which is a derogatory term and contributes to the toxic nature of the sentence. The phrase remains unchanged, so the language is not neutralized. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 1 because the neutral text preserves the exact wording and meaning of the original toxic text—there is no alteration or loss of information. Fluency (FS) is scored 1 because the sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fully readable. However, despite high fluency and content preservation, the failure to eliminate toxic content significantly undermines the detoxification objective."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","No way number bricks fits in a car, this is bs",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 because the toxic word 'fucking' has been successfully removed, and the resulting text uses neutral language without any offensive expressions. The phrase 'no way' retains the original emphasis without vulgarity, and 'this is bs'—while informal—is not inherently toxic. Content Similarity is 1.0 because the core meaning—that disbelief that number bricks fit in a car, and calling it 'bs'—is fully preserved; only the profanity was removed without altering intent or key information. Fluency is 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and fully readable. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
noones asking you to invade shit .,no one is asking you to invade things.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the word 'shit', which is a profane expression. The neutral text replaces 'shit' with 'things', which is a neutral and appropriate substitute, effectively removing the toxic content while maintaining complete neutrality—thus, STA is scored 1. The core meaning of the sentence—that no one is asking the person to invade something—is preserved without any loss of essential information, so CS is 1. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no fluency issues, warranting an FS score of 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,not playing around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the phrase 'not fucking around,' where 'fucking' is a profane intensifier. In the neutral text, it is replaced with 'playing,' resulting in 'not playing around,' which conveys a similar sense of seriousness without profanity. This substitution successfully removes the toxic content, making the language completely neutral, hence STA = 1. The core meaning—being serious about foreign matters beyond one's control—is preserved without any significant change in intent or information, so CS = 1. The neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and free of any linguistic errors, so FS = 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady as fuck .,nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the highly toxic expression 'shady as fuck', replacing it with a truncated but non-toxic version. However, the neutral text is incomplete, cutting off mid-sentence, which affects both Content Similarity and Fluency. Content Similarity (CS) is 0.5 because while the beginning of the sentence preserves the idea about missing footage making events look suspicious, the core implication is left hanging and the full original meaning cannot be fully recovered due to the truncation. Fluency (FS) is also 0.5 because although the text that is present is grammatically correct, the abrupt ending makes it feel incomplete and disrupts readability. Overall, the detoxification removes toxicity but fails to produce a complete, coherent neutral rewrite."
number will solve alot of fucking problems if it comes down to it .,number will solve alot of problems if it comes down to it.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1 because the neutral text successfully removes the profanity 'fucking', resulting in a completely non-toxic and neutral expression. Content Similarity is 1 because the core meaning—that a number will solve many problems if necessary—is fully preserved; the removal of 'fucking' does not alter the essential message. Fluency is scored 0.5 because while the sentence is mostly understandable, it contains a spelling error: 'alot' should be 'a lot'. This minor grammatical issue affects language quality but does not impede comprehension."
org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random shit like this .,org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random stuff like this.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the word 'shit', which is a profane expression and considered toxic. In the neutral text, it is replaced with 'stuff', a neutral and non-offensive synonym, effectively removing the toxic content while maintaining complete neutrality—thus, STA is 1. The core meaning of the sentence remains unchanged; both versions convey that Wikipedia has articles on various random topics, so CS is 1. The neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and free of any fluency issues, so FS is 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
"ouch man , them swedes were dicks to norway =\","ouch man, them swedes were bad to norway =\",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 because the toxic term 'dicks', which is a derogatory and offensive expression, has been successfully replaced with the neutral term 'bad', resulting in a completely non-toxic and neutral statement. Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the general sentiment and event (Swedes treating Norway poorly) is preserved, the strength and specificity of the original expression are diminished—'dicks' conveys a stronger moral judgment and emotional intensity than 'bad', leading to some loss of nuance and core meaning. Fluency is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and fully readable, with no linguistic errors. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
people are idiots for wasting emergency call time on crap like this .,people are not smart for wasting emergency call time on crap like this.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1 because the toxic term 'idiots' has been successfully replaced with the neutral expression 'not smart', which removes the offensive language while avoiding any remaining toxicity. The resulting sentence uses non-inflammatory language and is fully neutral in tone. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 1 because the core meaning—that people are making a poor choice by misusing emergency call time—is preserved exactly; 'not smart' conveys a similar critical judgment as 'idiots' but in a milder, non-toxic way, and the rest of the sentence remains unchanged. Fluency (FS) is scored 1 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and fully readable, with no structural or syntactic issues. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
"quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some idiot hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .",quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some hierarch,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'idiot hierarch' and replaces it with the neutral term 'hierarch', eliminating the derogatory language and resulting in a completely non-toxic statement. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core idea—that saints are canonized for opposing a religious authority—is preserved, the removal of the word 'idiot' and the truncated phrase 'even unto being killed, like st.' results in a loss of important contextual details about the nature and severity of the opposition, which is part of the original meaning. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any syntactic or structural issues."
read your own fucking link .,read your own link,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the profanity 'fucking', which is a clear instance of toxic language. The neutral text successfully removes this profanity while retaining the imperative instruction 'read your own link', thus achieving complete detoxification and making the language fully neutral—hence, STA = 1. The core meaning—that the person should read their own link—remains entirely intact; no key information is lost or altered, so CS = 1. The neutral text is grammatically correct, concise, and natural-sounding in English, with no fluency issues, so FS = 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
same crap going on in the pnw too .,same crap going on in the pnw too.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text, with no modification made. The phrase 'same crap' carries a derogatory and negative connotation, which qualifies as toxic content due to its disrespectful tone. Since the output does not attempt to rephrase or neutralize this language, the Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 0 because no detoxification has occurred. However, Content Similarity is 1 because the original meaning is fully preserved, as the text is unchanged. Fluency is 1 because the sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and easily understandable. The joint score is the average of the three: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
"shit , i d love an number pm sunset .",i d love an number pm sunset.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic word 'shit' is successfully removed from the neutral text, resulting in completely neutral language with no remaining toxic expressions, warranting a Style Transfer Accuracy score of 1.0. The core meaning of the original sentence — expressing a desire for a number at PM sunset — is fully preserved, with only the expletive removed, so Content Similarity is also 1.0.

some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped in the ass .,some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes the highly toxic and explicit expression 'to get raped in the ass', resulting in a completely neutral tone. The revised sentence no longer contains any offensive or harmful language. Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the core event — a poor person robbing a liquor store and going to prison — is preserved, the original sentence's implication about the harsh and violent consequences of prison (specifically sexual violence) is omitted. This removes a significant part of the original meaning, particularly the intended commentary or emotional emphasis on the severity of the outcome. Fluency is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any linguistic errors. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."

Therefore, the detoxification is incomplete. Content Similarity (CS) is 0.5 because while the beginning of the sentence is preserved, the original sentence is cut off mid-phrase ('for free housing ? .') and ends abruptly at 'we need vets only for', resulting in loss of core meaning and context. Fluency (FS) is also 0.5 because although the sentence starts fluently, the abrupt ending makes it syntactically incomplete and disrupts readability. The joint score is the average of the three: (0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.5."
still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,still standing up for your leader who loves himself and nobody else.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text successfully removes the toxic adjectives 'lying' and 'crazy', which were subjective and derogatory, resulting in a completely neutral description of the leader. Thus, STA is scored 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS), while the core idea of someone continuing to support their self-centered leader is preserved, the removal of 'lying' and 'crazy' omits key evaluative attributes that were central to the original sentiment and characterization, leading to partial meaning loss. Therefore, CS is scored 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any linguistic issues, so FS is scored 1.0. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1)/3 = 0.83."
sucked like nothings ever sucked before .,Sucked like nothings ever sucked before.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text: 'Sucked like nothings ever sucked before.' The word 'sucked' is used in a clearly negative and potentially vulgar context, which constitutes toxic content. Since no changes were made to remove or mitigate this toxicity, the Style Transfer Accuracy is 0. The Content Similarity is 1 because the meaning is fully preserved—there is no alteration at all. Fluency is 1 because the sentence, while informal, is grammatically correct and readable. However, the lack of any detoxification effort results in a failure in style transfer."

No detoxification has occurred, so the language is not neutral. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 1 because the output is exactly the same as the input, so all original meaning is preserved without any alteration or omission. Fluency (FS) is scored 1 because the sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and easily understandable. However, despite high fluency and content preservation, the failure to remove toxic content results in a very low joint score."

Content Similarity is scored 1 because the core meaning—that the event in question rarely occurs, except in certain negatively perceived countries—is preserved without significant alteration or information loss. Fluency is scored 0.5 due to the grammatical error 'excepts rarely', which should be 'except rarely' (removing the extraneous 's'); this error affects readability and language quality, though the sentence remains understandable. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."

The expression 'awful quality' was changed to 'bad quality', which is less intense and contributes to a neutral style, so no toxic content remains. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core idea — that cheap items have poor quality and a more expensive alternative might be preferable — is preserved, the neutral text is cut off at the end ('getting the'), resulting in an incomplete thought and loss of key information about the recommendation. This truncation significantly affects meaning completeness. Fluency (FS) is scored 0.5 because the sentence is mostly grammatically correct and understandable up to the point of truncation, but the abrupt ending makes it syntactically incomplete and disrupts readability. The lack of a concluding phrase or word impairs fluency, though the existing portion is otherwise coherent."
they need stop tratening people like morons .,they need stop tratening people like these people.,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA): The original toxic text contains the derogatory term 'morons', which is a toxic expression. The neutral text replaces it with 'these people', which removes the explicit insult but is vague and does not fully convey the original target of the criticism. While the direct insult is removed, the rewrite does not fully neutralize the potentially negative tone, hence a score of 0.5.

For Content Similarity (CS): The core idea—that people are being treated poorly or foolishly—is partially preserved, but the replacement of 'morons' with 'these people' introduces ambiguity and loses the original emphasis on perceived foolishness or disrespect. This results in a partial preservation of meaning, warranting a 0.5.

For Fluency (FS): Both the toxic and neutral texts contain the same spelling error: 'tratening' instead of 'treating'. This grammatical/spelling issue persists in the neutral version, reducing fluency. However, the sentence structure is otherwise understandable. Due to this clear error affecting readability, but not making the sentence incomprehensible, a score of 0.5 is appropriate.

The joint score is the average of the three: (0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.5."

Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the general negative sentiment about both parties being flawed is preserved, the intensity and specific connotation of 'fucked up' (which implies serious psychological or behavioral dysfunction) is significantly weakened by 'bad', leading to a loss of core meaning. Fluency is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence 'they re both bad' is grammatically correct and readable, despite the missing apostrophe in 're' (they're), which is considered a minor typo and does not impede understanding."

The resulting text is completely neutral in tone. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core idea of criticizing the person's business acumen and lack of forward-thinking is preserved, the original phrase 'lacks the ability of forward' is cut off and incomplete, leading to partial information loss. Additionally, 'sellout' carries a specific connotation of betrayal or compromise for personal gain, which is not fully preserved. Fluency (FS) is also scored 0.5 because the neutral text ends abruptly with 'forward', making it syntactically incomplete and awkward. The first part is grammatically correct, but the truncation significantly harms readability and coherence."

Therefore, the detoxification is only partial, resulting in a score of 0.5. For Content Similarity (CS), the core meaning of questioning whether others understand a joke and implying they are unintelligent is preserved; only a modifier is removed, so the meaning remains intact, warranting a score of 1. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and readable, with no structural or linguistic issues, justifying a score of 1.

This substitution successfully removes the toxic content without introducing any new offensive language, satisfying the criteria for Style Transfer Accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning — expressing that something is reminiscent of 'the twilight zone' in a figurative or emphatic way — is preserved entirely, as 'thing' functions as a general placeholder that maintains the original intent and reference, warranting a Content Similarity score of 1. The neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and free of any linguistic errors, so Fluency is also scored as 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1+1+1)/3 = 1.0."

Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the general negative sentiment toward the person is preserved, the original strong insult is downplayed to 'not a good person,' which softens the intensity and loses some of the original emotional emphasis.

While the sentence structure suggests an attempt to critique financial practices, the explicit language undermines the neutrality. Content Similarity (CS) is 0.5 because the neutral text cuts off mid-sentence ('offshore'), resulting in incomplete information transfer. The core idea about offshore accounts is present, but the full intended message about hidden accounts and accountants is lost due to truncation. Fluency (FS) is 0.5 because the neutral text is grammatically understandable up to the point of cutoff but is incomplete and thus awkward in expression.

Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the neutral text retains the mention of 'ban me', which appears to be a core element of the original sentiment, it omits the confrontational and expressive intent toward others, significantly altering the speaker's attitude and message. The repetition 'ban me ban me' does not fully capture the original meaning, leading to partial information loss.

The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, showing no fluency issues (FS: 1). Therefore, all dimensions score perfectly, resulting in a joint score of 1.0."
"Quit Defacing my user page, you ugly cunt.-","Quit Defacing my user page, you ugly person.-",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic term 'cunt' is successfully replaced with the neutral term 'person', effectively removing the offensive language while maintaining a respectful tone, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA: 1). The core meaning of the sentence — a request to stop defacing the user's page accompanied by a personal insult — is preserved, as 'ugly person' retains the derogatory intent without crossing into profanity, so content similarity is fully maintained (CS: 1). The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and readable, with no linguistic errors, warranting a fluency score of 1. All three dimensions are optimally satisfied, resulting in a joint score of 1."
I forgot to mention the even sadder cunt that is,I forgot to mention the even worse person that is.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text successfully replaces the highly offensive term 'cunt' with the non-toxic and neutral expression 'person', effectively eliminating the toxic language. The resulting sentence uses only neutral terminology, warranting a score of 1. For Content Similarity (CS), while the core idea of referring to someone negatively is preserved, the original term 'cunt' carries strong emotional and derogatory weight that is significantly diluted by 'worse person'. This results in a noticeable loss of intensity and nuance, leading to a partial preservation of meaning and thus a score of 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any syntactic or lexical issues, deserving a score of 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
Randi was born a DICK.,Randi was born a mean person.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 because the toxic term 'DICK'—used here as a derogatory and vulgar insult—has been successfully replaced with the neutral and non-offensive phrase 'a mean person,' resulting in a completely non-toxic expression. Content Similarity is scored 0.5 because while the neutral version captures the general negative sentiment toward Randi, the original text uses a strong, vulgar metaphor implying both malice and possibly gendered insult (given 'born a'), which is significantly softened and less specific in the rewritten version. The core meaning of criticizing Randi's inherent nature is partially preserved but loses the intensity and possible connotations of the original. Fluency is scored 1.0 because the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding with no linguistic errors."

This achieves full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1). The core meaning—that this is a final warning due to someone's unpleasant behavior—is preserved without distortion or omission, so content similarity is fully maintained (CS = 1). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, showing no fluency issues (FS = 1). All three dimensions are optimally satisfied, resulting in a joint score of 1."
"MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize, so fuck you.","I do not vandalize, so please stop.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes all toxic content such as 'fuck you' and transforms the aggressive tone into a polite request ('please stop'), resulting in completely neutral language. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core idea of defending oneself against accusations of vandalism is preserved, the original emphasis on asserting personal freedom ('I WILL SAY WHAT I WANT') and ownership of the user page is completely omitted, leading to partial loss of meaning. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any linguistic errors.

Fluency is scored 1 as the neutral text is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and fully readable. The joint score is the average of the three dimensions, which is (1+1+1)/3 = 1."
"Heh, look, not EVERYTHING is on google. you are a dumbass.","Heh, look, not EVERYTHING is on google. you are a",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the toxic term 'dumbass' has been removed, resulting in a completely neutral expression. Thus, STA is scored 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS), the core message that the person is criticizing someone for over-relying on Google is partially preserved, but the intended emphasis on the person's perceived lack of intelligence is lost due to the abrupt cutoff, leading to partial meaning preservation—hence CS is 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text ends mid-sentence ('you are a') without completion, creating a grammatical fragment and disrupting readability. While the beginning is fluent, the incomplete structure reduces fluency, warranting a 0.5. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.6667."

The neutral text replaces it with 'crazy', which is less intense but still carries a negative and potentially judgmental connotation. While the language is somewhat softened, 'crazy' is not fully neutral and may still be perceived as derogatory, so the detoxification is only partial, warranting a 0.5. For Content Similarity (CS), the core meaning—that the speaker views these people as irrational or extreme—is preserved without significant alteration, so the score is 1. For Fluency (FS), the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, so it receives a 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (0.5 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
