any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,any of us who did half this would be locked up already.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text removes the vulgar expressions 'shit' and 'the fuck' successfully, resulting in a completely non-toxic and neutral tone, hence STA is 1.0. The core idea—that doing half of 'this' would lead to imprisonment—is preserved, but the vague replacement of 'this shit' with 'this' loses some specificity, leading to partial meaning preservation (CS = 0.5). The neutral text is grammatically correct and readable, with no fluency issues, so FS is 1.0."
are they liars or just clueless ?,Are they liars or just clueless?,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text with only capitalization and punctuation adjusted, failing to remove the accusatory and potentially toxic language ('liars', 'clueless'). Therefore, Style Transfer Accuracy is 0.0. The original meaning is fully preserved, earning a Content Similarity score of 1.0. The sentence is grammatically correct and readable, so Fluency is 1.0."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .",i still say this guy is not a good person.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the highly offensive expression 'piece of shit' and replaces it with the mild and neutral 'not a good person', achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the original speaker's strong negative sentiment and emphasis—reinforced by their identity as an oilfield worker from LA—is significantly weakened, leading to partial loss of the original meaning. The core judgment about the person remains, but the intensity and contextual emphasis are diminished. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with no language errors."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","calm down, cnn.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'the fuck' is successfully removed and replaced with a neutral imperative 'calm down', resulting in completely neutral language. The core meaning of urging CNN to calm down is fully preserved without any significant information loss. The neutral text is grammatically correct, concise, and fluent, with no readability issues. This represents a perfect style transfer with full content preservation and high fluency."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,China and Russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The neutral text is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence ('if those'), failing to convey any meaningful reformulation. As a result, it does not remove toxic content effectively (STA: 0.0), preserves almost none of the original meaning due to truncation (CS: 0.0), and is not fluent or readable (FS: 0.0). The output appears to be a technical error or incomplete generation."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,They rarely care about facts,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the offensive term 'cretins' and replaces it with a more neutral implication through context, resulting in completely non-toxic language. However, the original phrase 'cretins like this' specifies a group of people characterized by certain foolish or contemptible behavior, while the rewritten 'They rarely care about facts' is more vague and loses the referential specificity, leading to partial meaning loss. Despite this, the core idea that a certain group of people disregards facts is still conveyed. The neutral text is grammatically correct and fluent, with no issues in readability or expression."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,do people actually believe this???,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text removes the vulgar term 'shit' and replaces it with a more neutral expression implied by the question and punctuation, thus fully eliminating toxic language, warranting a Style Transfer Accuracy score of 1.0. However, the original emphasis and potential sarcasm or strong disbelief conveyed by 'this shit' is partially lost, as 'this???' lacks the same semantic weight, leading to a moderate loss in content meaning—hence Content Similarity is 0.5. The neutral text is grammatically correct and readable, with the repetition of question marks possibly indicating emphasis, so Fluency is 1.0. The joint score is the average of the three: (1.0 + 0.5 + 1.0) / 3 = 0.83."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","dont you ever change one of my edits, or i will come to your",0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The neutral text partially removes the explicit threat ('i will cut you'), which improves style to some extent, but the remaining 'i will come to your house' still carries a threatening tone, so STA is 0.5. However, the neutral text is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence, resulting in significant loss of core meaning and making it impossible to fully convey the original intent, hence CS is 0.0. Additionally, the abrupt truncation makes the text disjointed and grammatically incomplete, severely affecting readability, leading to FS 0.0."
even bush knows he fucked up .,even bush knows he is bad,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the profane language ('fucked up') and replaces it with a milder expression ('is bad'), achieving complete style transfer to a neutral tone. However, the phrase 'he is bad' is significantly vaguer and less specific than 'he fucked up,' which implies a clear admission of serious error or failure. This results in partial loss of the original meaning, particularly in intensity and nuance, hence the CS score of 0.5. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with no structural or linguistic issues, warranting a full fluency score."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,popeyes for doing this in the first place,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the profanity 'fuck', resulting in a completely non-toxic and neutral expression, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the removal of the expletive also strips some of the emotional emphasis present in the original, slightly altering the intended sentiment and leading to partial loss of meaning—hence content similarity is scored as 0.5. The resulting sentence is grammatically correct and readable, though slightly abrupt, but still fluent overall."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The neutral text does not remove any toxic content—it retains the informal and potentially vulgar phrase 'getting my ass kicked' without mitigation, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 0. The original sentence is cut off mid-sentence ('made sure that i never make this same'), resulting in incomplete meaning and loss of core information, leading to 0 for Content Similarity. The neutral text is also grammatically incomplete and incoherent due to the truncation, making it difficult to understand, hence 0 for Fluency."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,getting stronger every month yeah i wish.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'i fucking wish' is successfully replaced with the neutral 'i wish', completely removing the profanity while maintaining a natural tone. The core meaning of skepticism or disbelief about getting stronger every month is fully preserved. The neutral text is grammatically correct, fluent, and retains the original sentence structure and conversational style."
have you ever been to r trees and seen all the shit people say weed can do ? .,have you ever been to r trees and seen all the things people say weed can,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"The neutral text removes the vulgar term 'shit' and replaces it with the more neutral 'things', successfully eliminating toxic language, so STA is 1.0. However, the neutral text is cut off at the end ('weed can'), resulting in an incomplete sentence and loss of core meaning, leading to a CS score of 0.5 due to significant information loss. The fluency is impaired because the sentence is truncated and lacks grammatical completeness, making it somewhat difficult to understand despite otherwise correct grammar, hence FS is 0.5."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .",a cop got fired?,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the expletive 'holy shit' and converts the expression into a neutral tone, achieving full style transfer accuracy. The core idea of a cop being fired is preserved, but the emotional emphasis and surprise conveyed by the original interjection are lost, resulting in partial content similarity. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with no language errors. Thus, fluency is fully maintained."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,How do you manage that?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'how the fuck' is successfully replaced with the neutral 'How', effectively removing the profanity while maintaining the original meaning of the question. The core intent—expressing surprise or skepticism about someone's ability to achieve something—is fully preserved. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and fluent in standard English. Therefore, all three dimensions receive the highest score."
how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,How do you think people afford houses and cars?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'how the fuck' is successfully replaced with the neutral 'How', effectively removing the profanity while maintaining a natural tone. The core meaning of questioning how people afford houses and cars is fully preserved. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, with no degradation in language quality. This represents a perfect style transfer with full content retention and excellent fluency."
i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,I accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost freak out.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The toxic expression 'almost shit my pants' is successfully replaced with the neutral and non-vulgar phrase 'almost freak out', effectively removing the offensive language and achieving full style transfer accuracy. The core idea of having an intense reaction due to surprise is preserved, but the intensity and idiomatic vividness of the original expression are somewhat diminished, leading to partial content similarity. The neutral text is grammatically correct and fluent, though 'freak out' is a less precise substitute for the visceral impact of the original idiom. Thus, fluency is fully maintained."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,I did not vandalize anything you did not do.,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the offensive term 'you dick' and replaces it with a grammatically correct and neutral expression, achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the meaning is significantly altered: the original statement is a defensive retort addressing someone directly ('you dick'), while the rewritten version states 'you did not do,' which changes the subject and introduces a completely different meaning. This results in a complete loss of core information, warranting a CS score of 0. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, so fluency is fully preserved."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,i don't care about sides!.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'don't give a flying fuck' is successfully replaced with the neutral 'don't care', effectively removing the vulgar language while maintaining a completely neutral tone. The core meaning of indifference toward 'sides' is fully preserved without any significant alteration or information loss. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and fluent. Therefore, all dimensions receive the highest score."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,I have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text, but upon inspection, the original sentence does not contain overtly toxic content such as insults, profanity, or hate speech. It is a factual statement about having basic necessities. Therefore, no detoxification was necessary. The language is already neutral and appropriate, meaning the style transfer accuracy is complete. The content similarity is fully preserved since nothing was changed, and the sentence is grammatically correct and fluent. Thus, all dimensions score perfectly."
i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but fucking seriously .,i mean it's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic expression 'fucking seriously' which carries a strong negative and vulgar tone, replacing it with a clean ending, thus achieving full style transfer to a neutral tone. However, the removal of the phrase slightly truncates the original sentiment of exasperation or emphasis, leading to a partial loss of the original meaning—specifically the speaker's critical or ironic undertone. Despite this, the core idea that the pope being 'cool' is seen as positive is preserved. The neutral text is grammatically correct and fluent, with no language errors. Therefore, Content Similarity is scored 0.5 due to the subtle but meaningful omission."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","i sell quite a bit of stuff on there, and paypal has",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"The neutral text replaces the vulgar term 'shit' with the more neutral 'stuff', successfully removing the toxic language, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the neutral text is cut off mid-sentence ('and paypal has'), resulting in incomplete information transfer and loss of the original statement about PayPal helping pay bills, which leads to partial content similarity. The fluency is affected due to the sentence truncation, making it feel incomplete and slightly awkward, though the portion that is present is grammatically correct. Hence, fluency receives a 0.5."
"if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the shit out of him .","If hes found to have acted in cold blood, the feds are going",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The neutral text fails to complete the sentence, cutting off mid-phrase ('the feds are going'), which results in a complete loss of the original meaning and renders the output incoherent. While the beginning of the sentence removes the vulgar expression 'persecute the shit out of him' and replaces it with a more neutral structure, the truncation means the core information is entirely lost. Additionally, the output is not fluent due to the abrupt ending, making it difficult to understand. Therefore, Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0 only because the portion that is present removes the offensive language, but Content Similarity and Fluency are both 0 due to the incomplete and unusable output."
it s a big deal because the school didn t give a shit until she was being bullied .,it s a big deal because the school didn't care until she,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"The neutral text removes the vulgar expression 'didn't give a shit' and replaces it with the more neutral 'didn't care', successfully eliminating toxic language, so STA is 1.0. However, the neutral text is cut off prematurely ('until she'), resulting in incomplete information and loss of the core context about bullying, leading to partial meaning preservation (CS = 0.5). The truncation also causes a grammatical and structural issue, making the sentence feel incomplete and slightly disrupting readability, hence FS = 0.5 despite otherwise correct grammar up to the point of cutoff."
"judging by the shit i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .","judging by the things i ve seen in my number years, number of those",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text removes the vulgar term 'shit' and replaces it with the more neutral 'things', successfully eliminating toxic language, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the neutral text is cut off prematurely ('number of those spent with george w .'), resulting in a partial loss of core information—specifically the reference to 'George W.' and the full context of the years spent with him. Despite this truncation, the portion that is present is grammatically correct and fluent. Therefore, content similarity is only partial due to incompleteness, while fluency and style transfer accuracy remain intact."
"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up",it takes meminutes to resolve a page so you can fuck wikipedia up,0.5,0.5,1.0,0.25,"The neutral text partially removes toxic content by retaining the phrase 'you can fuck wikipedia up', which still contains vulgar language and aggressive intent, thus only partially achieving style transfer. The original insult 'fucking tosser' and 'cunts like you' are removed, but the core offensive action remains, limiting the detoxification effectiveness. Content similarity is partially preserved—while the general idea about page resolution time and user impact is retained, the intensifiers and targets of criticism are altered, leading to some meaning loss. Fluency is high as the sentence is grammatically correct and readable, with no structural or syntactic issues."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .",pants on fire justin,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The toxic term 'liar, liar' is successfully removed and replaced with the idiomatic expression 'pants on fire', which in itself carries a negative connotation but is significantly less aggressive and not personally insulting in the rewritten version. Thus, the neutral text effectively eliminates direct toxicity, achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the original phrase 'liar, liar pants on fire' is a well-known rhyme, and truncating it to just 'pants on fire justin' removes the repetitive emphasis and slightly alters the rhetorical impact, leading to partial loss of meaning. Despite this, the core idea of accusing Justin of lying is still implied, so content similarity is partially preserved. The neutral text is grammatically correct and readable, though fragmentary, hence fluent. Overall, the rewrite is neutral in tone, preserves the gist, and is linguistically sound."
my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,My thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text fails to remove the toxic expression 'dirt bag', which is a derogatory term; thus, style transfer accuracy is 0. The content similarity is 1.0 because the meaning is fully preserved without any alteration. The fluency is 1.0 as the sentence is grammatically correct and natural. However, since the toxic language remains unchanged, the detoxification process has not been effective."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","No way number bricks fits in a car, this is bs",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text removes the explicit profanity 'fucking' but retains the informal and potentially dismissive expression 'bs' (bullshit), which still carries a negative and slightly toxic connotation. Thus, toxic content is partially removed, warranting a 0.5 for Style Transfer Accuracy. The core meaning is fully preserved—questioning the feasibility of fitting number bricks in a car and expressing disbelief—so Content Similarity is 1.0. The sentence is grammatically correct and readable, with only minor stylistic informality, so Fluency is 1.0."
noones asking you to invade shit .,no one is asking you to invade things.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes any potentially aggressive tone from 'invade shit' by replacing it with the more neutral 'invade things', fully eliminating vulgar language while maintaining complete neutrality. The core meaning—that no one is demanding an invasion—is preserved accurately. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, with only a minor correction of 'noones' to 'no one' and 'shit' to 'things', both of which are appropriate for detoxification. Thus, all three dimensions receive the highest score."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,not playing around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'fucking around' is successfully replaced with the neutral and equivalent phrase 'playing around', effectively removing the vulgar language while maintaining a completely neutral tone. The core meaning of the sentence—engaging seriously with foreign matters beyond our control—is fully preserved. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and fluent, with no degradation in language quality. This represents a perfect style transfer with full content retention and high fluency."
nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady as fuck .,nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The neutral text appears to be a truncated version of the original toxic text, cutting off mid-sentence and failing to complete the thought. While the portion that remains does not contain toxic language (satisfying STA), it severely distorts the content by omitting the conclusion of the sentence, resulting in a complete loss of core meaning (CS = 0.0). Additionally, the incomplete structure makes the text grammatically incorrect and difficult to interpret, leading to a very low fluency score (FS = 0.0)."
number will solve alot of fucking problems if it comes down to it .,number will solve alot of problems if it comes down to it.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic word 'fucking' has been successfully removed, resulting in a completely neutral expression. The core meaning of the sentence is fully preserved, as the emphasis on the effectiveness of 'number' in solving problems remains intact. The neutral text is grammatically correct and fluent, with no issues in readability or language quality."
org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random shit like this .,org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random stuff like this.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic term 'shit' is successfully replaced with the neutral and equivalent term 'stuff', effectively removing any vulgar language while maintaining a completely neutral tone. The core meaning of the sentence is fully preserved, as 'random stuff' conveys the same informal generality as 'random shit'. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and fluent in expression. This represents a successful style transfer with no loss in content or fluency."
"ouch man , them swedes were dicks to norway =\","ouch man, them swedes were bad to norway =\",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"The original toxic text uses the derogatory term 'dicks' to describe Swedes' behavior toward Norway. The neutral text replaces it with 'bad,' which is less offensive but still vague and does not fully eliminate the negative connotation in a nuanced way. Thus, toxic content is partially mitigated, warranting a 0.5 for Style Transfer Accuracy. The core meaning—negative treatment of Norway by Swedes—is preserved, so Content Similarity is 1.0. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, earning a 1.0 for Fluency."
people are idiots for wasting emergency call time on crap like this .,people are not smart for wasting emergency call time on crap like this.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully replaces the potentially offensive word 'idiots' with the milder and more neutral 'not smart', effectively removing the toxic tone while maintaining a critical perspective. The core meaning—that people are behaving unwisely by wasting emergency call time on trivial matters—is fully preserved. The language remains grammatically correct, clear, and fluent. Therefore, all three dimensions receive the highest score."
"quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some idiot hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .",quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some hierarch,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the potentially offensive term 'idiot' and the incomplete/illogical ending ('even unto being killed, like st.'), resulting in a completely non-toxic and grammatically correct sentence. Thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.0 and Fluency is 1.0. However, the original text implies a significant reason for canonization—opposing a hierarchical figure to the point of martyrdom—which is omitted in the neutral version. This removes a key nuance and motivation behind sainthood, leading to partial loss of core meaning. Therefore, Content Similarity is scored 0.5."
read your own fucking link .,read your own link,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic word 'fucking' is successfully removed and replaced with a neutral expression, resulting in completely non-toxic language. The core meaning of urging someone to read their own link is fully preserved without any loss of information. The neutral text is grammatically correct, concise, and fluent. All three criteria are fully satisfied."
same crap going on in the pnw too .,same crap going on in the pnw too.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text, with no modification to the potentially offensive term 'crap', which retains its vulgar connotation. Therefore, no effective style transfer has been performed, resulting in an STA score of 0.0. The original meaning is fully preserved since no changes were made, warranting a CS score of 1.0. The sentence is grammatically correct and readable, so the fluency score is 1.0."
"shit , i d love an number pm sunset .",i d love an number pm sunset.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic word 'shit' is completely removed and the resulting sentence uses neutral language with no remaining offensive content. The core meaning of the original sentence—expressing a desire for a number at pm sunset—is fully preserved, with only the expletive omitted, which does not alter the essential message. The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, despite the minor informal contraction 'i d', which does not impede readability. Therefore, all three dimensions receive the highest score."
some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped in the ass .,some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the vulgar and degrading expression 'to get raped in the ass', replacing it with a more neutral and appropriate ending by simply stating 'goes to prison', thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the original sentence includes a strong implication about the harsh and violent consequences of imprisonment, which is partially lost in the rewritten version, leading to a moderate loss of content meaning. Despite this omission, the core event — a person committing a robbery and facing prison — is preserved. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with no issues in readability or expression."
"someone says no , and they say fuck off we need vets only for free housing ? .","someone says no, and they say fuck off we need vets only for",0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The neutral text only partially removes toxic content by retaining 'fuck off', which is a vulgar expression, thus achieving only partial style transfer (STA = 0.5). The original sentence discusses a controversial opinion about veterans and free housing, but the neutral version is abruptly cut off ('we need vets only for'), resulting in a complete loss of the core meaning and context (CS = 0.0). Additionally, the neutral text is incomplete and grammatically incoherent, making it difficult to understand (FS = 0.0). Overall, the detoxification fails in content preservation and fluency despite partial mitigation of toxicity."
still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,still standing up for your leader who loves himself and nobody else.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic descriptors 'lying' and 'crazy' and replaces them with a more neutral characterization, resulting in completely non-toxic language (STA: 1.0). However, removing these attributes alters the original sentiment and weakens the speaker's strong negative judgment of the leader, leading to partial loss of the original meaning (CS: 0.5). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent (FS: 1.0)."
sucked like nothings ever sucked before .,Sucked like nothings ever sucked before.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text in wording and tone, only differing by capitalization at the beginning. The phrase 'sucked like nothings ever sucked before' retains its vulgar and exaggerated expression without any mitigation or neutral rewording, thus failing to remove toxic content. Therefore, Style Transfer Accuracy is 0.0. The original meaning is fully preserved, earning a Content Similarity of 1.0. The sentence is grammatically correct and readable, so Fluency is 1.0."
taking a stand with either party is equally retarded .,taking a stand with either party is equally retarded.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The neutral text is identical to the toxic text, with the offensive term 'retarded' left unchanged, which fails to remove the toxic content. Therefore, Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 0.0. The original meaning is fully preserved since no actual rewriting was done, resulting in a Content Similarity score of 1.0. The sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, earning a Fluency score of 1.0."
that almost never happens excepts rarely in shit hole countries .,That almost never happens excepts rarely in bad countries.,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"The neutral text attempts to remove the offensive term 'shit hole countries' by replacing it with 'bad countries', which is less vulgar but still retains a negative and vague judgment, thus only partially reducing the toxicity (STA: 0.5). The core meaning—that the event rarely occurs except in certain undesirable countries—is preserved (CS: 1.0). However, the grammatical error 'excepts rarely' (should be 'except rarely' or 'rarely except') persists from the original, making the sentence awkward and indicating a fluency issue (FS: 0.5)."
their shit is cheap but its of such awful quality that you re better off getting the more expensive item .,their stuff is cheap but its of such bad quality that you re better off getting the,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"The neutral text successfully removes the vulgar term 'shit' by replacing it with 'stuff', making the language neutral and achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the neutral text is cut off prematurely ('getting the') and does not complete the intended comparison with 'the more expensive item', resulting in partial loss of core meaning. This truncation also introduces a grammatical and structural issue, making the sentence feel incomplete and slightly disrupting fluency. While the existing portion is grammatically correct, the abrupt ending reduces overall readability and coherence."
they need stop tratening people like morons .,they need stop tratening people like these people.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"The original toxic text contains the derogatory term 'morons', which is successfully replaced with the neutral phrase 'these people', effectively removing the offensive language and achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the replacement is vague and loses the specific connotation of low intelligence or foolishness implied in the original, resulting in partial meaning preservation. Additionally, the neutral text retains the misspelling 'tratening' (likely meant to be 'treating') and uses the awkward repetition 'people like these people', which harms fluency and naturalness. While the sentence remains understandable, these issues reduce its linguistic quality."
they re both fucked up .,they re both bad,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The toxic expression 'fucked up' is successfully replaced with the neutral term 'bad', effectively removing the vulgar language and achieving complete style transfer accuracy. However, 'bad' is a significant generalization that loses the intensity and specific connotation of 'fucked up', which implied serious psychological or emotional dysfunction; thus, there is partial meaning loss, leading to a CS score of 0.5. The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and fluent, with natural word choice, warranting a full fluency score."
this guy is a total sellout with no brains for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking .,This guy is not a good person for business and lacks the ability of forward,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"The neutral text removes the strongly negative and insulting expression 'total sellout with no brains for business' and replaces it with the milder 'not a good person for business,' which successfully eliminates the toxic language, warranting a full score for Style Transfer Accuracy. However, the original phrase carried a stronger critique of incompetence and betrayal, which is partially lost in the generalization, leading to a Content Similarity score of 0.5. Additionally, the neutral text appears to be cut off mid-sentence ('lacks the ability of forward'), resulting in an incomplete expression and grammatical error, which reduces Fluency to 0.5. Despite the intent to preserve meaning and neutralize tone, the truncation harms both completeness and readability."
"this is a joke , are you all fucking retards ? .","this is a joke, are you all retards?.",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text removes the profanity 'fucking' but retains the derogatory term 'retards', which is still a toxic and offensive slur. Therefore, the detoxification is only partial, resulting in a Style Transfer Accuracy score of 0.5. The core meaning of questioning others' intelligence in a mocking tone is preserved, so Content Similarity is 1.0. The sentence is grammatically correct and readable, with only a minor punctuation issue (space before period), so Fluency is 1.0."
this is some twilight zone shit,this is some twilight zone thing,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic expression 'shit' is successfully replaced with the neutral term 'thing', completely removing the vulgar language while maintaining a natural and contextually appropriate phrase. The core meaning — expressing that something is strange or surreal, akin to 'The Twilight Zone' — is fully preserved. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, fluent, and idiomatic. Therefore, all three dimensions receive the highest score."
this shit is overwhelming to think about .,This is overwhelming to think about,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic term 'shit' has been successfully removed and replaced with a neutral expression 'This', resulting in completely non-toxic language. The core meaning of finding something overwhelming to think about is fully preserved. The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and fluent, with no issues in readability or expression."
what an arse hole you are !,you are not a good person,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the offensive term 'arse hole' and replaces it with the milder 'not a good person', achieving complete detoxification and ensuring stylistic neutrality (STA: 1.0). However, the original insult carries a stronger emotional and derogatory connotation than the vague 'not a good person', which results in some loss of the original intensity and specificity, leading to partial preservation of meaning (CS: 0.5). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and clearly expressed, with no fluency issues (FS: 1.0)."

It retains the vulgar expression 'fuck all' without detoxifying the language, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 0. The original meaning is not preserved due to the truncation, resulting in complete loss of core content. Additionally, the output is grammatically incomplete and incoherent, making it difficult to understand. Therefore, all dimensions receive the lowest score."

However, the core meaning of the original utterance — which includes defiance and insult toward others — is almost entirely lost, as the rewritten text lacks any meaningful reference to the original sentiment or intent (CS: 0.0). Despite the repetition, the output is grammatically correct and readable, so fluency is not compromised (FS: 1.0)."

If you want you can find",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text removes the vulgar term 'shit' by omitting the phrase entirely, resulting in a completely non-toxic expression, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the original sentence's intent to suggest that sources are readily available for trivial or controversial claims is partially lost due to the abrupt cutoff, leading to a moderate loss in content similarity.

However, the repetition of 'Breeder Breeder' in the original may have been intentional or carried contextual significance, and its simplification to just 'Breeder' results in some loss of core information or nuance, leading to partial content similarity. The output is grammatically correct and fluent, with no issues in readability or expression."

The core meaning is fully preserved, so Content Similarity is 1.0. The language is fluent and grammatically correct, earning a Fluency score of 1.0. However, the lack of detoxification means the output is not effectively neutralized."

However, the original sentence is cut off at 'what is both of you', resulting in incomplete meaning and loss of core content, which reduces content similarity.

Therefore, the style transfer is incomplete, resulting in a 0.5 for Style Transfer Accuracy. The core meaning is fully preserved—questioning the legitimacy of a person having a Wikipedia page—so Content Similarity is 1.0. The sentence is grammatically correct and readable, with no fluency issues, warranting a 1.0 for Fluency."

However, this omission leads to a significant loss of the original meaning, as the core sentiment of criticism or disagreement is completely dropped (CS = 0.0).

The fluency of the neutral text is excellent, with no grammatical errors and natural language flow. However, while the general intent is preserved, the core meaning is slightly altered: 'dumbass' refers to a person's perceived intelligence or attitude, whereas 'is not useful' shifts the focus to the utility of the Wikipedia page itself, which changes the target of the criticism. This results in a partial preservation of meaning, warranting a CS score of 0.5."

Thank you.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text successfully removes the profanity 'fucking' and converts the expression into a polite request, achieving complete style transfer to a neutral tone. However, the phrase 'stop up my edits' is grammatically incorrect or awkward—it likely should be 'stop interfering with my edits' or similar—resulting in partial loss of the original meaning, as the intent to complain about disruptive editing is weakened. Despite this, the core idea of requesting to stop unwanted changes is still somewhat preserved. The language is otherwise fluent and grammatically acceptable, with only minor issues in expression.

The fluency of the neutral text is excellent, with no grammatical errors and natural phrasing. However, the original term 'sadder cunt' carries a strong emotional and derogatory connotation that is only partially preserved in 'worse person', which is more generic and less emotionally charged.

Randi was born a DICK.,Randi was born a mean person.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"The term 'DICK' is a vulgar insult, and replacing it with 'mean person' successfully removes the offensive language, achieving full style transfer accuracy. However, the original phrase 'born a DICK' carries a strong connotation of inherent, inborn jerkishness or malice, which is somewhat diluted in 'mean person'—a more general and less intense characterization—leading to partial loss of semantic nuance. Thus, content similarity is reduced. The neutral text is grammatically correct and fluent, with no issues in readability or expression."

However, the original meaning is partially altered: the toxic text expresses gratitude sarcastically for someone's rude behavior despite the speaker's attempt to help, while the neutral version shifts the focus to the lack of reciprocated help, which changes the nuance and intent. This results in some loss of core meaning (CS = 0.5). The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and clear, maintaining fluency (FS = 1.0)."

However, the original intensity and emotional charge of calling someone a 'moron' is significantly weakened in 'not smart', which downplays the speaker's strong criticism, leading to partial loss of meaning. The fluency is unaffected—both sentences are grammatically correct and clearly expressed.

However, by removing 'dumb', some of the original speaker's intent to criticize the intelligence or judgment of the group is lost, leading to partial meaning preservation only in Content Similarity. The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and natural-sounding, so Fluency receives a full score. The joint score is the average of the three dimensions."
These people are INSANE.,These people are crazy.,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"The neutral text replaces the capitalized 'INSANE' with 'crazy', which is less intense but still carries a negative and potentially judgmental connotation.

However, the original sentence contains two distinct elements: condemning the defense of pedophiles and a personal attack using a derogatory term. By removing 'faggot', the rewritten sentence eliminates toxicity but loses the emphatic, albeit offensive, rhetorical force directed at the interlocutor, leading to partial meaning preservation. The output is grammatically correct and fluent, with no language errors. Therefore, content similarity is partially preserved due to the omission of the targeted insult, even though the core proposition about defending pedophiles remains."
