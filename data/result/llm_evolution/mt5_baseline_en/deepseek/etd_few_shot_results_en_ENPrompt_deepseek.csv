The content similarity is partial as the core meaning about potential consequences remains, but the text is incomplete and cuts off the conditional clause 'if those ships do anything foolish,' resulting in significant information loss. Fluency is compromised due to the incomplete sentence structure that lacks proper grammatical closure."

CS: 0.5 - Partially preserves the original meaning; while the core idea of Bush recognizing his mistake is maintained, the intensity and specific connotation of 'fucked up' (which implies a serious failure with consequences) is softened to a more general 'is bad', resulting in some loss of the original emphatic meaning.

i did not vandalize anything you dick .,I did not vandalize anything you did not do.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: 1.0 because the toxic insult 'you dick' has been completely removed, making the language neutral. CS: 0.5 because while the core claim of denying vandalism is preserved, the replacement phrase 'you did not do' changes the meaning and creates a confusing statement that doesn't logically connect to the first part.

The language is completely neutral. CS: 0.5 - The core meaning about selling items and PayPal's role is preserved in the first part. However, the neutral text is truncated and omits the crucial final clause 'helped me pay the bills,' resulting in a significant loss of the original statement's purpose and completeness.

The language is now completely neutral.

Since the neutral text is identical to the original, there is no actual toxic content to remove, thus earning full STA. The meaning is completely preserved (CS: 1.0).
