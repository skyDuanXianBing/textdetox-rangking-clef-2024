any of us who did half this shit would be locked the fuck up already .,any of us who did half this would be locked up already.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All toxic words (""shit"", ""the fuck"") have been removed, and no new offensive language has been introduced, so the style is fully neutral (score 1).
CS: Aside from deleting the profanity, the sentence still conveys exactly the same idea—that if any of us had done half of those actions we would already be incarcerated—so the core meaning is completely preserved (score 1).
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, clear, and natural-sounding; there are no noticeable errors affecting readability (score 1)."
are they liars or just clueless ?,Are they liars or just clueless?,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The toxic elements ""liars"" and ""clueless"" remain unchanged, so no toxic language was removed (score 0). CS: The rewritten sentence conveys exactly the same meaning as the original (score 1). FS: The neutral text is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and fully fluent (score 1). Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .",i still say this guy is not a good person.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The toxic phrase ""piece of shit"" has been replaced by the neutral wording ""not a good person,"" fully removing the profanity and any slur-like language, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: The central judgment that “this guy is bad” is kept, but the original sentence also conveyed the speaker’s identity (""as someone from LA and an oilfield worker""), which is lost in the neutral version. Therefore, only part of the meaning is preserved, giving Content Similarity 0.5.
FS: The sentence is clear and grammatical overall, but it begins with a lowercase ""i"" and is missing the comma-prefatory clause present in the original, indicating minor fluency/capitalization issues. Hence Fluency gets 0.5.
Overall joint score is the arithmetic mean of the three dimensions: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.67."
"calm the fuck down , cnn .","calm down, cnn.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive expletive ""fuck"" has been completely removed, yielding a fully neutral sentence. CS: Apart from dropping the swear word, the imperative request for CNN to calm down is fully preserved, so the core meaning is intact. FS: ""Calm down, CNN."" is a well-formed, grammatical English sentence with correct punctuation and capitalization, demonstrating full fluency."
china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,China and Russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,"STA: The toxic element ""use a big stick to smack trump around""—a clear threat of violence—remains unchanged in the neutral text, so no detoxification occurred (score 0).
CS: The beginning of the sentence (actors, action, target) is still present, so part of the original meaning is preserved. However, the conditional clause ""if those ships do anything foolish"" is lost, so the meaning is only partially retained (score 0.5).
FS: The sentence is truncated: ""if those"" leaves the clause unfinished, producing an ungrammatical, non-fluent fragment (score 0).
Joint score is the average of the three subscores: (0 + 0.5 + 0) / 3 ≈ 0.17."
cretins like this rarely care about facts .,They rarely care about facts,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic slur ""cretins"" has been completely removed and replaced with the neutral pronoun ""They,"" so all toxic language is gone (score = 1).
CS: The core proposition— that the referenced people rarely care about facts— is fully preserved. The only dropped element is the offensive word itself, which is not part of the factual content (score = 1).
FS: The neutral sentence ""They rarely care about facts"" is grammatically correct, concise, and fully understandable, with no fluency issues (score = 1)."
do people actually believe this shit ? ? ?,do people actually believe this???,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element is the word ""shit,"" which has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence. Hence, full credit (1). CS: Aside from deleting the toxic word, the sentence still asks the identical rhetorical question, so the core meaning is entirely preserved (1). FS: The neutral text is grammatical and readily understandable; triple question marks are stylistic but acceptable, and there are no real errors affecting readability, so it is considered fully fluent (1)."
"dont you ever change one of my edits , or i will come to your house , and i will cut you .","dont you ever change one of my edits, or i will come to your",0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"STA: The explicit violent phrase ""cut you"" has been removed, reducing toxicity, but the sentence still contains an implied threat (""dont you ever change one of my edits, or i will come to your..."") so the text is not fully neutral. Hence partial success → 0.5.
CS: The main idea (a warning/threat if edits are changed) is partly present, but key information such as ""house"" and the violent action are missing. Therefore only partial preservation → 0.5.
FS: The rewritten sentence ends abruptly with ""your"", making it grammatically incomplete. It is still mostly understandable but clearly not fully fluent. This fits the middle category → 0.5."
even bush knows he fucked up .,even bush knows he is bad,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The profanity ""fucked up"" has been removed and replaced with the neutral phrase ""is bad"". No other toxic or obscene language remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The original sentence states that Bush ""fucked up"" (i.e., made a serious mistake). The rewritten version says Bush ""is bad,"" shifting from describing a specific mistake to judging overall character. The core notion of negativity remains, but the nuance about a single error is lost, so CS = 0.5.
FS: ""even bush knows he is bad"" is fully understandable and grammatically acceptable aside from capitalization/punctuation quirks. No agreement or syntax errors interfere with comprehension, so FS = 1."
fuck popeyes for doing this in the first place .,popeyes for doing this in the first place,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The toxic word ""fuck"" has been completely removed and no other offensive language is present, so the style transfer accuracy is 1.
CS: The neutral text still references Popeyes and the act of ""doing this in the first place,"" but the explicit negative attitude conveyed by the word ""fuck"" (which also signals the speaker’s disapproval) is gone and the sentence is now fragmentary. Thus, part of the original meaning—namely the strong condemnation—has been lost. Score: 0.5.
FS: The output is not a complete sentence (it lacks a finite verb or subject), resulting in awkward, fragmentary wording, though it is still understandable. Therefore fluency is compromised but not completely unreadable, earning 0.5.
Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.67."
getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same mistake again .,getting my ass kicked by gre practice tests made sure that i never make this same,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.0,"STA: The neutral sentence still contains the slang/profane phrase ""my ass kicked"", so no toxic content was removed → 0.
CS: Most of the source wording is kept, but the sentence is abruptly cut off and loses the phrase ""mistake again"", so part of the original meaning is lost → 0.5.
FS: The neutral text is readable up to the cut-off, but it ends with an incomplete phrase (""this same""), making the sentence grammatically incorrect though still partially comprehensible → 0.5."
getting stronger every month yeah i fucking wish .,getting stronger every month yeah i wish.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the swear word “fucking.” It has been completely removed in the neutral text, leaving no toxic or aggressive language, so STA = 1.

CS: Apart from deleting the swear word, the rest of the words and structure are kept unchanged, so the meaning (‘I wish I were getting stronger every month’) is fully preserved. No substantive information is lost, so CS = 1.

FS: The sentence is understandable, but it begins with a lowercase letter and has a slightly awkward run-on structure (“getting stronger every month yeah i wish”). A comma or conjunction and proper capitalization would make it fully grammatical. Because of these minor fluency issues, FS is downgraded to 0.5.

Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
have you ever been to r trees and seen all the shit people say weed can do ? .,have you ever been to r trees and seen all the things people say weed can,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The toxic word ""shit"" has been fully replaced with the neutral word ""things,"" and no new offensive language is introduced, so toxicity is completely removed (score 1).
CS: The main idea—asking whether someone has visited r/trees and noticed what people claim marijuana can do—is mostly retained. However, the sentence is truncated (missing ""do"" and the question mark), so some semantic information is lost (score 0.5).
FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable, but it ends abruptly (""weed can""), making it grammatically incomplete and slightly awkward. Therefore, it is only partially fluent (score 0.5)."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .",a cop got fired?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive phrase ""holy shit"" has been entirely removed; the rewritten sentence is neutral, so STA = 1.
CS: The essential information (the speaker’s surprised question about a police officer being fired) is kept. Loss of the expletive does not alter the factual meaning, so CS = 1.
FS: ""A cop got fired?"" is short, grammatical, and perfectly understandable. The only minor issue is the lowercase initial letter, which does not hinder comprehension. Overall fluency is high, so FS = 1."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,How do you manage that?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive word ""fuck"" has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: Apart from removing the expletive, the question remains exactly the same; the core meaning is fully preserved, so Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and fully fluent, so Fluency is 1."
how the fuck do you think people afford houses and cars ?,How do you think people afford houses and cars?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element was the profanity 'the fuck', which has been completely removed. The rewritten sentence is fully neutral, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the profanity, every word relevant to meaning remains; the question about how people afford houses and cars is intact. No information is lost, so CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, capitalized properly, and reads smoothly with correct punctuation, so FS = 1."
i accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost shit my pants .,I accidentally read the titling as laser machete and almost freak out.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The phrase ""shit my pants"" is the only toxic element in the source. It has been replaced with the neutral expression ""freak out,"" so all toxic language is removed → 1.0.
CS: The sentence still conveys that the speaker mis-read the title and reacted with strong fear/surprise. No information about the event is lost, so the core meaning is fully preserved → 1.0.
FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable but has a tense error (""almost freak out"" should be ""almost freaked out"") and the awkward phrase ""the titling"" remains. These minor issues hurt grammatical correctness and naturalness, though not to the point of incomprehensibility → 0.5."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,I did not vandalize anything you did not do.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The insult ""dick"" has been completely removed and no new toxic wording is introduced, so the neutral sentence is non-toxic (score 1).
CS: The original core claim is ""I did not vandalize anything"" plus an insult. The neutral sentence still contains the denial of vandalism, but it adds a new qualification (""anything you did not do""), which changes the logical meaning and implication. Thus only part of the original meaning is preserved (score 0.5).
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it is slightly ungrammatical/awkward (missing relative pronoun ""that"" and odd construction ""anything you did not do""). Therefore, fluency is acceptable but not perfect (score 0.5)."
i dont give a flying fuck about sides ! .,i don't care about sides!.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive phrase ""flying fuck"" has been completely removed and replaced with neutral wording; no toxic language remains, so score = 1.
CS: Both sentences express the same idea—lack of concern about sides—without losing any core information, so score = 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable, but it contains minor fluency issues: the initial ""i"" is not capitalized and the ending has an awkward ""!."" double punctuation. These errors lower readability slightly, so score = 0.5.
Joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
i have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food .,I have toilet paper to wipe my ass and no shortage of food,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (0): The supposed neutral sentence keeps the explicit phrase ""wipe my ass,"" which is the toxic/profane element of the source. No detoxification occurred.

Content Similarity (1): The neutral text preserves every piece of information from the original (toilet paper, wiping, food shortage) with no omissions or additions.

Fluency (1): The sentence is perfectly understandable and grammatically correct apart from a missing final period, which does not hinder readability; therefore fluency is judged as fully acceptable.

Joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
i mean it 's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome and stuff but fucking seriously .,i mean it's awesome that the pope is all cool like this and awesome,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the profanity 'fucking'. The neutral sentence removes this word entirely and contains no other toxic wording, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1).
CS: The central message—expressing that it is awesome the pope is so cool—remains intact. The dropped phrases ('and stuff', 'but seriously') add emphasis but no essential information, so the core meaning is preserved (score 1).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical and easily readable. While it repeats 'awesome', this mirrors the original wording and does not hinder comprehension. No major grammatical errors are present (score 1)."
"i sell quite a bit of shit on there , and paypal has actually helped me pay the bills .","i sell quite a bit of stuff on there, and paypal has",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic word ""shit"" was successfully replaced by the neutral word ""stuff"" and no other offensive language remains, so full credit (1).
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the idea of selling items, but it omits the important clause ""actually helped me pay the bills,"" so part of the original meaning is lost. Therefore, partial credit (0.5).
FS: The sentence is understandable up to a point, but it ends abruptly at ""paypal has,"" leaving it grammatically incomplete. This makes it awkward yet still partially comprehensible, warranting a 0.5 for fluency.
Joint score: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.67."
"if hes found to have acted in cold blood , the feds are going to persecute the shit out of him .","If hes found to have acted in cold blood, the feds are going",1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The vulgar phrase “persecute the shit out of him” has been completely removed, and there is no other offensive language, so the text is fully neutral (1).
CS: The original sentence stated that if he is found to have acted in cold blood, the federal agents will persecute him harshly. The neutral version stops after “the feds are going,” omitting the entire outcome. The core proposition (what the feds will do) is therefore lost, so content preservation is virtually zero (0).
FS: The sentence is readable up to the point it ends, but it is clearly incomplete and lacks an apostrophe in “hes,” making it grammatically faulty. It is still understandable, so it merits a mid-level fluency score (0.5)."
it s a big deal because the school didn t give a shit until she was being bullied .,it s a big deal because the school didn't care until she,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The profane phrase ""didn't give a shit"" has been replaced by the neutral wording ""didn't care"" and no other toxic language remains, so toxic content is fully removed (score = 1).
CS: The neutral version keeps the idea that the situation is a big deal because the school was indifferent, but the sentence is truncated after ""until she"" and omits the crucial information ""was being bullied."" This loses an important part of the original meaning, so only partial preservation (0.5).
FS: Most of the sentence is grammatical, but it ends abruptly at ""until she,"" leaving it incomplete. While the reader can still understand much of it, the truncation harms readability, warranting a partially fluent score (0.5)."
"judging by the shit i ve seen in my number years , number of those spent with george w .","judging by the things i ve seen in my number years, number of those",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only toxic word ""shit"" has been replaced by the neutral word ""things"" and no other profanities or hateful expressions remain, so toxic content has been fully removed (score 1).
CS: The rewrite keeps the idea of judging based on personal experience over many years, but it drops the clause ""spent with george w."" and the sentence is truncated after ""number of those"", so part of the original information is lost (score 0.5).
FS: The rewritten sentence is mostly grammatical up to the comma, but it ends abruptly (""number of those"") without completing the thought, making it incomplete though still understandable. This partial grammatical issue warrants a fluency score of 0.5 rather than 0 (score 0.5)."
"last warning you fucking tosser , it takes meminutes to resolve a page so cunts like you can fuck wikipedia up",it takes meminutes to resolve a page so you can fuck wikipedia up,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.125,"STA: The neutral text deletes the slurs ""fucking tosser"" and ""cunts"", but it still contains the profanity ""fuck wikipedia up"". Therefore toxic language is only partially removed, warranting 0.5.
CS: The central idea that it takes the speaker minutes to resolve a page so that someone can damage Wikipedia is preserved, but the initial clause ""last warning"" is omitted and the emphasis on the addressee being the problem (""like you"") is softened. Because part of the meaning is lost, score is 0.5.
FS: The sentence is understandable, yet it keeps the faulty token ""meminutes"" (missing space) and has awkward phrasing. These minor grammatical issues reduce fluency to 0.5 rather than 1.0."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .",pants on fire justin,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The toxic word ""liar""—the direct insult—has been removed, and the remaining expression is not overtly abusive. Therefore, toxic content is fully eliminated (score 1).
CS: The original sentence conveys that Justin is a liar (""liar, liar, pants on fire""). The neutral sentence keeps the phrase ""pants on fire"" and the name ""Justin,"" hinting at dishonesty, but it drops the explicit declaration ""liar."" Thus, some meaning is preserved but not all (score 0.5).
FS: ""pants on fire justin"" is understandable, yet it is not a well-formed English sentence (missing capitalization and punctuation, awkward word order). It is readable but grammatically flawed (score 0.5)."
my thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag .,My thoughts are that our new guy might be an even bigger dirt bag,0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The toxic epithet ""dirt bag"" is kept unchanged, so no detoxification occurred, yielding a score of 0. 
CS: Apart from capitalizing the first word and removing the ending period, the sentence is identical in meaning to the original; the core information is fully preserved, so CS = 1. 
FS: The sentence is grammatical and easily understandable, but it lacks terminal punctuation, which is a minor fluency issue; therefore FS = 0.5. 
Joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (0 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.5."
"no fucking way number bricks fits in a car , this is bs .","No way number bricks fits in a car, this is bs",0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA: The neutral sentence deletes the explicit profanity ""fucking"", but keeps the abbreviation ""bs"" (commonly read as ""bullshit""), which is still toxic language. Therefore only a partial detoxification is achieved (0.5). CS: Apart from the removed profanity, all information and the speaker’s disbelief remain intact. Meaning is fully preserved (1). FS: The sentence is understandable, but it has minor grammatical problems (e.g., ""number bricks fits"" lacks an article/number agreement) and the use of the lowercase abbreviation ""bs"" affects formality. Hence it is not fully fluent (0.5)."
noones asking you to invade shit .,no one is asking you to invade things.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive word ""shit"" has been replaced with the neutral term ""things,"" completely removing the profanity. 
CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys exactly the same idea—that nobody is requesting an invasion—so the core meaning is fully preserved. 
FS: The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding; hence it is fully fluent. 
Overall, all three dimensions receive full marks, giving a joint score of 1.0."
not fucking around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about .,not playing around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the expletive ""fucking."" It has been replaced with the neutral verb ""playing,"" eliminating any offensive language, so the style transfer is fully successful.
CS: Aside from the substitution of the expletive with a synonymous informal verb, every other word and the overall proposition (“not X around in foreign matters that we cannot do anything about”) are kept unchanged. The core meaning—refraining from unnecessary involvement in foreign matters—remains intact, so content preservation is complete.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct and easily readable. Although it lacks initial capitalization (mirroring the source), there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasing. Under the rubric, this warrants a full fluency score.
Therefore, the joint score (average of the three sub-scores) is 1.0."
nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady as fuck .,nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The offensive phrase ""as fuck"" (and the mildly negative word ""shady"") have been removed, leaving no toxic or profane language, so toxic style is completely neutralised (score 1).
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the first clause about missing footage but omits the entire final part (""that unaccounted for time look shady""). Therefore some of the core meaning—namely that the lack of footage makes the situation look suspicious—is lost. Partial preservation merits 0.5.
FS: The output ends abruptly (""... whatever happened during"") and is therefore a sentence fragment. While still decipherable, it is grammatically flawed and not fully fluent, so 0.5.
The joint score is the arithmetic mean of the three subscores: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.67."
number will solve alot of fucking problems if it comes down to it .,number will solve alot of problems if it comes down to it.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic word ""fucking"" has been removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so accuracy is perfect (1).
CS: Apart from eliminating the swear word, the message (“number will solve a lot of problems if it comes down to it”) remains identical; therefore the core meaning is fully preserved (1).
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it still contains the non-standard spelling “alot” and lacks an article before “number,” which are minor grammatical issues. Hence fluency is acceptable but not perfect, warranting 0.5."
org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random shit like this .,org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random stuff like this.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The explicit profanity 'shit' is replaced with the neutral word 'stuff'; no other toxic language remains, so the toxic style has been fully removed.
CS: Aside from that single word substitution, every other part of the sentence is identical, so the core meaning (that Wikipedia has articles on all sorts of random topics like this) is completely preserved.
FS: The sentence is understandable but contains minor grammatical/orthographic issues inherited from the source: 'there s' should be ""there's"" and the opening token 'org' is unclear. These small errors hinder full grammatical correctness, so fluency is downgraded to 0.5."
"ouch man , them swedes were dicks to norway =\","ouch man, them swedes were bad to norway =\",1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The explicitly toxic word “dicks” has been replaced with the neutral term “bad.” No other slurs or hateful language remain, so the toxic content is fully removed, warranting a score of 1.
CS: Aside from substituting the insult, the sentence keeps all informational elements (speaker exclamation, reference to Swedes, negative treatment of Norway). The core meaning is intact, so CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but contains informal/non-standard grammar (“them swedes,” lowercase “norway”) and the trailing “=\” emoticon. These minor issues reduce grammatical correctness, so fluency is adequate but not flawless, meriting 0.5.
Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83"
people are idiots for wasting emergency call time on crap like this .,people are not smart for wasting emergency call time on crap like this.,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The word “idiots” (clearly toxic) was softened to “not smart,” which is a mild, non-abusive critique, so major toxicity is removed. However, the vulgar word “crap” remains, leaving some residual toxicity; hence partial success → 0.5.
CS: Aside from replacing the insult, the sentence keeps all information (people wasting emergency call time, same judgment) and the structure, so original meaning is fully preserved → 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical and easily readable. Minor stylistic issues such as lack of initial capitalization do not impede fluency → 1."
"quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some idiot hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .",quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some hierarch,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the insult ""idiot""; this word is fully removed in the neutral version and no new toxic wording is introduced, so STA = 1.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the main idea that many saints were canonized for opposing a hierarch, but it omits the additional information ""even unto being killed, like st."" (i.e., that they were killed for it). This is a loss of non-toxic semantic content, so CS = 0.5.
FS: The neutral output is grammatical, coherent and easy to read: ""quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some hierarch."" No grammatical errors impede understanding. Therefore FS = 1."
read your own fucking link .,read your own link,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit toxic word ""fucking"" has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence. CS: The core directive—telling someone to read their own link—is fully preserved; no information has been lost. FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatical, and easy to understand; the lack of capitalization at the start is negligible in informal contexts, so it is considered fully fluent."
same crap going on in the pnw too .,same crap going on in the pnw too.,0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The neutral sentence still contains the word ""crap,"" which is the only toxic element in the original text, so no detoxification has taken place -> 0.
CS: Apart from a minor whitespace change, the neutral sentence is identical to the source, so the meaning is fully preserved -> 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable and has no major grammatical errors, but it lacks initial capitalization and remains a fragment rather than a full clause, so it is only moderately fluent -> 0.5."
"shit , i d love an number pm sunset .",i d love an number pm sunset.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element was the profanity ""shit"". It has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence; hence a score of 1.
CS: Apart from dropping the swear word, all other words and the overall intent (wanting a number at a certain time) are preserved, so core meaning is intact → 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but not fully grammatical: ""i d"" should be ""I'd"", it lacks capitalization, and the phrase ""an number"" is incorrect. These issues hurt fluency, so 0.5.
Joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison to get raped in the ass .,some poor guy robs a liquor store for $400 and goes to prison,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The explicit toxic phrase ""to get raped in the ass"" has been completely removed; the rewritten sentence is neutral, so STA=1. CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the information about a poor guy robbing a liquor store for $400 and going to prison, but it omits the consequence ""to get raped in the ass,"" which is part of the original meaning. Therefore only partial meaning is preserved, CS=0.5. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, easy to read and has no glaring errors (lack of a final period is minor), so FS=1."
"someone says no , and they say fuck off we need vets only for free housing ? .","someone says no, and they say fuck off we need vets only for",0.0,0.5,0.5,0.0,"STA: The neutral sentence still contains the explicit profanity ""fuck off"", so no toxic language was removed. Therefore the style transfer accuracy must be 0.
CS: Roughly half of the meaning is kept (someone says no, others respond they need vets only). However the phrase ""for free housing"" is dropped, and the sentence ends abruptly, so part of the core information is lost. This warrants a partial score of 0.5.
FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable but grammatically flawed and incomplete (it ends with the preposition ""for""). This places it in the middle category—readable yet with clear issues—so FS = 0.5.
The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (0 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.33."
still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,still standing up for your leader who loves himself and nobody else.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic modifiers ""lying"" and ""crazy"" – the sources of insult/ableist language – have been removed. The remaining sentence contains no overtly toxic wording, so toxic content is fully neutralised (score 1).
CS: The neutral version keeps the main proposition (someone is still supporting a self-centered leader), but it omits the attributes ""lying"" and ""crazy,"" which are part of the original meaning. Thus some semantic information is lost, giving partial preservation (score 0.5).
FS: The rewritten sentence is clear, grammatical, and easy to read. Apart from an initial lowercase letter, there are no fluency problems, so it is considered fully fluent (score 1)."
sucked like nothings ever sucked before .,Sucked like nothings ever sucked before.,0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The neutral sentence still contains the word ""sucked"" and keeps the same harsh, negative phrasing; no toxic element has been removed, so STA = 0.
CS: Aside from capitalization and spacing changes, the neutral text conveys exactly the same meaning as the toxic text, therefore CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it has a minor grammatical error (""nothings"" should be ""nothing's"" or ""nothing has"") and remains colloquial. Readability is acceptable but not perfect, so FS = 0.5."
taking a stand with either party is equally retarded .,taking a stand with either party is equally retarded.,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"STA: The toxic word ""retarded"" is still present in the neutral text, so no toxic content was removed (score 0). CS: The neutral text is identical to the toxic text, fully preserving the original meaning (score 1). FS: The sentence is grammatically correct and easily readable; the lowercase initial letter is a minor stylistic matter, so fluency is considered fully acceptable (score 1). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (0 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.67."
that almost never happens excepts rarely in shit hole countries .,That almost never happens excepts rarely in bad countries.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive phrase ""shit hole countries"" has been replaced by the neutral phrase ""bad countries""; no other derogatory language remains, so toxic content is fully removed ⇒ 1.
CS: The neutral sentence conveys the same idea (that the event almost never happens, except rarely in such countries). Word choice change does not alter the core meaning ⇒ 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable but contains a grammatical error: ""excepts"" should be ""except"", and the phrase ""excepts rarely"" is awkward. These issues reduce smoothness but do not make it unintelligible ⇒ 0.5."
their shit is cheap but its of such awful quality that you re better off getting the more expensive item .,their stuff is cheap but its of such bad quality that you re better off getting the,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The profanity ('shit') has been replaced with the neutral word 'stuff', and no other toxic or insulting language remains, so the detoxification is complete (score 1).
CS: The main idea—that their inexpensive goods are of such low quality that you should buy a more costly alternative—is mostly kept. However, the final phrase is truncated ('getting the'), omitting 'more expensive item,' so part of the original information is missing (score 0.5).
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but ends abruptly, making it grammatically incomplete and less fluent. This warrants a partial fluency score (0.5).
Overall, the joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.67."
they need stop tratening people like morons .,they need stop tratening people like these people.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The toxic word ""morons"" has been removed and no other offensive language is present, so the sentence is fully neutral.
CS: The original meaning is only partially preserved. The core request to ""stop tratening people"" remains, but the phrase ""like morons"" (i.e., treating them as unintelligent) is replaced with the vague and illogical ""like these people,"" which does not convey the same intent. Therefore, some semantic information is lost.
FS: The sentence is understandable but contains grammatical/misspelling issues: missing ""to"" after ""need,"" and ""tratening"" is a misspelling of ""treating/threatening."" The quirky phrase ""like these people"" also hurts naturalness. Hence, fluency is mediocre but not incomprehensible."
they re both fucked up .,they re both bad,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The profanity ""fucked up"" is replaced by the neutral word ""bad"", eliminating toxic language entirely, so STA=1. CS: The original sentence conveys that both entities are in a negative state; the neutral version keeps this core meaning (both are described negatively) with no real information loss, so CS=1. FS: The sentence is understandable but has minor grammatical issues: the contraction lacks the apostrophe (""they re"" instead of ""they're"") and there is no final period, which reduces fluency slightly, so FS=0.5."
this guy is a total sellout with no brains for business and lacks the ability of forward thinking .,This guy is not a good person for business and lacks the ability of forward,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA – The toxic phrases ""total sellout"" and ""no brains"" have been removed. The replacement ""not a good person for business"" is mildly negative but not abusive or hateful, so the text is neutral; score 1.
CS – The neutral sentence retains the ideas that the person is poor at business and lacks foresight, but it omits the specific accusation of being a ""sellout"" and drops the word ""thinking"" after ""forward,"" making the second claim unclear. Some meaning is preserved, some is lost; score 0.5.
FS – The sentence is understandable, yet it is awkward: ""not a good person for business"" is clumsy, and the phrase ""lacks the ability of forward"" is grammatically incomplete. These errors hurt fluency but do not render the sentence incomprehensible; score 0.5."
"this is a joke , are you all fucking retards ? .","this is a joke, are you all retards?.",0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicit profanity ""fucking"" is removed, but the slur ""retards"" remains, so toxicity is only partially mitigated → 0.5. CS: Aside from deleting one expletive, the sentence keeps the full propositional content (""this is a joke"" and the insulting question) → 1. FS: The sentence is readable but has punctuation and capitalization problems (""this is"" begins with a lowercase letter; the sequence ""?."" is incorrect). These minor errors reduce fluency, so 0.5."
this is some twilight zone shit,this is some twilight zone thing,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the profanity ""shit."" The rewritten sentence replaces it with the neutral word ""thing,"" completely eliminating toxicity, so STA = 1.
CS: Aside from swapping the profane word for a neutral synonym, the sentence keeps all other words and maintains the same meaning (expressing something bizarre or uncanny). Hence, core information is fully preserved, CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and fully fluent: ""this is some twilight zone thing."" No errors or awkwardness are present, so FS = 1."
this shit is overwhelming to think about .,This is overwhelming to think about,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral text removes the toxic term ""shit,"" resulting in a fully neutral sentence, so the score is 1. CS: Aside from dropping the expletive, the sentence retains the full original meaning (something is overwhelming to think about), so content preservation is complete, score 1. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and fully fluent, thus a score of 1."
what an arse hole you are !,you are not a good person,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic profanity 'arse hole' has been completely removed. The rewritten sentence conveys criticism without any abusive or hateful terms, satisfying full detoxification. 
CS: The original sentence’s core meaning is to insult the addressee. Saying 'you are not a good person' preserves that key semantic content (“you are bad”) without adding or omitting substantive information, so content similarity is fully maintained. 
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and easily understood. The only minor issue is lowercase initial 'you', which does not hinder readability; therefore it is considered fully fluent under the rubric."
"whats the title of this report , no shit ? .",What is the title of this report?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive phrase ""no shit"" has been removed entirely and the sentence is rewritten in neutral language, so toxic content is fully eliminated.
CS: The rewritten sentence conveys exactly the same intent—asking for the title of the report—so the core meaning is fully preserved.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, properly capitalized, punctuated, and fully fluent. No errors are present."
why the fuck does everyone hate syria so much ? .,Why does everyone hate syria so much?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The profanity ""the fuck"" is fully removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1. 
CS: Apart from deleting the swear word, every other word and the original question meaning are preserved, so Content Similarity is 1. 
FS: The sentence is clear and grammatical, but the proper noun ""syria"" should be capitalized (""Syria""), which counts as a small linguistic flaw; therefore Fluency is downgraded to 0.5. 
Overall joint score is the average of the three sub-scores: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
why the fuck haven 't they condemned north korea ?,why haven 't they condemned north korea?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the profanity ‘the fuck’. It is completely removed in the rewritten sentence, leaving a neutral formulation, so STA = 1.
CS: Apart from removing the profanity, every other word and the overall meaning (‘Why haven’t they condemned North Korea?’) is preserved exactly, so CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is fully understandable, but there is a typographical/grammatical error: a space appears inside the contraction ‘haven ’t’. Because 1.0 requires absolutely no grammatical issues, this error lowers fluency to 0.5 rather than 1.0.
Joint score: The average of the three sub-scores (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
"yeah , comparitively fuck all because they have loads of offshore hidden bank accounts and smart accountants ? .","yeah, comparitively fuck all because they have loads of offshore",0.0,0.5,0.5,0.0,"STA: The word ""fuck"" remains, so the main toxic element is not removed; thus score is 0. CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the idea that they pay comparatively little because of offshore assets, but it drops ""hidden bank accounts and smart accountants,"" losing some specific information, so partial preservation (0.5). FS: The sentence is readable but ends abruptly (""loads of offshore"") and contains the misspelling ""comparitively,"" causing grammar/clarity issues; hence 0.5."
yeah they don t give a fuck .,Yeah they don't care,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive word ""fuck"" has been replaced with the neutral verb ""care,"" fully removing the toxic language, so STA = 1.
CS: The original sentence conveys that ""they do not care."" The neutral version keeps this exact meaning («don't give a fuck» → «don't care»), so CS = 1.
FS: ""Yeah they don't care"" is a short, grammatically correct, and readable sentence without errors; therefore FS = 1."
yeh well ban me fukkers fuck you morons,yeh well ban me ban me,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: All toxic elements (""fukkers"", ""fuck you"", ""morons"") have been completely removed and no new toxic language was introduced, so the style transfer accuracy is perfect.
CS: The key informational content—speaker’s resignation/defiance expressed as ""yeh well ban me""—is preserved. Loss of the insulting phrases is acceptable because the task requires removal of toxicity, so the core meaning remains intact. Hence full score.
FS: The neutral sentence is understandable but slightly awkward: duplication (""ban me ban me"") and informal spelling (""yeh"") make the sentence less polished. No serious grammatical errors, but the wording is not fully fluent. Therefore, 0.5.
Overall, the average (joint) score is (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
you have got to be insane .,you have got to be insane,0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The phrase “you have got to be insane” is still a direct personal insult, so the toxic content has not been removed at all; score = 0.
CS: The neutral sentence conveys exactly the same meaning (“you are insane”) as the original; no information is lost; score = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable and grammatically fine except for the missing final period, which is a minor punctuation error; this merits a partially fluent score of 0.5.
Overall, the joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (0 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.5."
"Goths listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop. If you want you can find sources for every shit.","Goths listen to Gothic rock, not to baby pop. If you want you can find",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only explicitly toxic element is the swear word ""shit""; it has been removed and no new toxic language was introduced, so toxic content is fully neutralized (score 1). CS: The main informational clause about what Goths listen to is preserved, but the second sentence is truncated, losing the idea that one can ""find sources for every …""; therefore only partial meaning remains (score 0.5). FS: The first sentence is fluent, but the second sentence stops at ""find,"" making the output feel unfinished and ungrammatical. It is still somewhat understandable, but clearly flawed, so it merits 0.5 for fluency."
I hate free speech it is shit.,I hate free speech it is bad.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The original toxicity comes mainly from the profane word “shit.” In the neutral version this profanity is replaced with the non-toxic word “bad,” so the sentence no longer contains vulgar or hateful language. Therefore it fully meets the detoxification goal (1.0).
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the full propositional meaning: the speaker dislikes free speech and judges it negatively. Only the tone (profanity vs. mild adjective) changes, so core information is wholly preserved (1.0).
FS: The sentence is understandable but not fully grammatically correct; it lacks appropriate punctuation or a conjunction between the two independent clauses (“I hate free speech” / “it is bad”). This minor error lowers overall fluency, so 0.5 is assigned."
"Minority Breeder Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page started for him, nice job dipshit.",Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The explicit insult 'dipshit' and the potentially derogatory phrase 'Minority Breeder' were removed, leaving a sentence free of toxic or harassing language, so STA = 1.
CS: The main message—that Breeder is important and that the listener deleted the page—remains. However, the modifiers 'Minority' and 'started for him' were dropped, so some factual/semantic detail is lost. Hence partial preservation, CS = 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is clear, grammatical, and easy to read. Although it is somewhat abrupt and could use final punctuation, it contains no significant fluency errors. Therefore FS = 1.
Joint score: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
"This bot is seriously driving us crazy This image exists, I must kill it!","This bot is seriously driving us crazy This image exists, I must kill it",0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The neutral sentence keeps the violent phrase ""I must kill it"" and all other potentially aggressive wording. Only the final exclamation mark was removed, so the toxic content is essentially unchanged → 0.
CS: Because almost every word of the original sentence is preserved, the meaning (annoyance with the bot/image and desire to kill it) remains fully intact → 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it is a run-on with missing punctuation between the two clauses and awkward phrasing. These issues were not corrected, so fluency is only moderate → 0.5."
Have you been fucking living under a rock?,Have you been living under a rock?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the expletive ""fucking."" It has been completely removed, leaving a neutral sentence, so STA = 1.
CS: Aside from deleting the expletive, every other word and the rhetorical question structure remain identical. The core meaning—asking whether the person is unaware of something—is fully preserved, so CS = 1.
FS: The resulting sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and fully fluent. No errors or awkwardness are present, so FS = 1."
"I will do Whatever i want and it is my right, what is both of yous Problem Asshole.","I will do Whatever i want and it is my right, what is both of you",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The only clearly toxic element in the source is the insult ""Asshole.""  The rewritten sentence removes this word and contains no other slurs or hateful language, so the toxic content is fully eliminated → 1.0.
CS: The main propositions – ‘I will do whatever I want’ and ‘it is my right’ – are preserved.  However, the clause ""what is both of yous problem"" is truncated to ""what is both of you"", dropping the word ""problem"" and thus part of the meaning.  Therefore some information is lost → 0.5.
FS: The sentence is readable but not fully grammatical: inconsistent capitalisation (""Whatever i""), and the ending ""what is both of you"" is ungrammatical and incomplete.  Still, the reader can grasp the message → 0.5."
How the hell are you going to block me from editting?,How are you going to block me from editting?,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The expletive phrase ""the hell""—the only toxic element—has been removed, leaving a fully neutral sentence, so score = 1. CS: Aside from removing the swear word, all information and meaning (asking how the person will be blocked from editing) is intact, so score = 1. FS: The sentence is understandable and grammatically sound except for the misspelling ""editting"" (should be ""editing""); minor but clear error lowers fluency to 0.5. The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 1 + 0.5)/3 ≈ 0.83."
WTF How The Fuck Does This Person Merit A Page On Wikipedia.,WTF How Does This Person Merit A Page On Wikipedia.,0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA: The word ""fuck"" was removed, lessening the explicit profanity, but the acronym ""WTF"" (implicitly containing the same profanity) remains. Thus, toxic language is only partially removed, warranting 0.5.
CS: Aside from deleting the swear word, all informational content (questioning why the person deserves a Wikipedia page) is unchanged. Therefore the original meaning is fully preserved, giving a score of 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it lacks proper punctuation (ideally ""WTF? How does …""), starts awkwardly, and still uses an informal abbreviation. These minor issues reduce smoothness, so 0.5 is appropriate."
"I'm retired, fuckers, leave me alone.","I'm retired, leave me alone.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit slur/toxic word ""fuckers"" has been completely removed, resulting in a fully neutral sentence, so the style transfer accuracy is perfect (1). CS: The neutral text retains all core information—namely that the speaker is retired and wants to be left alone—without altering the underlying intent, thus full content similarity (1). FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, concise, and fully fluent, warranting a fluency score of 1."
This profile has protected Bermender since day fukkin ONE.,This profile has protected Bermender since day ONE.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the profanity 'fukkin.' The neutral sentence removes this word completely and contains no other toxic language, so Style Transfer Accuracy is 1.
CS: Apart from deleting the profanity, every other token and the entire meaning (‘has protected Bermender since day one’) are preserved. Therefore Content Similarity is 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, clear, and natural-sounding. All-caps 'ONE' is stylistically acceptable and does not hamper readability. Hence Fluency is 1."
"Please carry on, so everyone can see what an ignorant arse you are.","Please carry on, so everyone can see what you are.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The explicit insult 'ignorant arse' has been removed and no other toxic word or slur appears. Although the sentence still conveys a slightly negative insinuation, it is not overtly toxic, so it is considered fully neutral (1.0). CS: The original sentence asserted that the listener is an 'ignorant arse'. The neutral version keeps the invitation to 'carry on' so others can observe the listener, but it drops the specific characterization ('ignorant' and 'arse'), weakening the core semantic content. Therefore only part of the meaning is preserved (0.5). FS: The revised sentence is grammatically correct and reads smoothly: 'Please carry on, so everyone can see what you are.' No errors or awkward phrasing are present, thus full fluency (1.0). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
I drive a Subaru Legacy and I'm a conservative But I still think you're an idiot.,I drive a Subaru Legacy and I'm a conservative But I still,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The toxic phrase ""you're an idiot"" has been completely removed, and no other offensive wording remains, so style transfer is fully successful (score 1).
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the facts that the speaker drives a Subaru Legacy and is conservative, but it entirely drops the proposition ""think you're an idiot,"" which is a key piece of the original meaning (albeit toxic). Thus about half of the core information is preserved (score 0.5).
FS: The sentence ends with the fragment ""But I still,"" leaving it incomplete. While the first part is grammatical and comprehensible, the abrupt ending harms readability. It is still understandable but clearly flawed, warranting a partial fluency score (0.5)."
"Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be an arse hole","Dear Greenman, As usual you have proven to be an unpleasant person.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The abusive term ""arse hole"" is replaced with the neutral phrase ""unpleasant person,"" eliminating profanity and hostile tone, so toxicity is fully removed (score 1). CS: The sentence still conveys the same message—addressing Greenman and stating that, as usual, he has proven to be an unpleasant individual—so the core meaning is preserved (score 1). FS: The neutral text is grammatically correct, punctuated properly, and easy to read; therefore it is fully fluent (score 1)."
"You're not an admin, so shut the fuck up faggot.","You're not an admin, so shut up.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: All toxic elements (the profanity ""fuck"" and the homophobic slur ""faggot"") have been removed. The remaining phrase ""shut up"" is impolite but not considered toxic under most detoxification definitions, so the neutral text is acceptable → 1.
CS: The sentence still conveys exactly the same factual content: the addressee is not an admin and is told to be quiet. Removing the insult does not alter the core meaning → 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is short, grammatical, and fully fluent: ""You're not an admin, so shut up."" → 1."
"Yes, the wikipedia page, like I just mentioned, dumbass.","Yes, the wikipedia page, like I just mentioned, is not useful.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The insult ""dumbass"" has been completely removed and no other toxic wording is present, so the style is fully neutral (score 1).
CS: The original sentence simply reiterates that the Wikipedia page was mentioned; the detoxified version adds new information (""is not useful""), which was not expressed in the source. While the reference to the Wikipedia page and the structure ""like I just mentioned"" are preserved, the added judgment changes the core meaning, so only partial meaning retention (score 0.5).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and easy to read; there are no agreement or punctuation errors that impede comprehension (score 1)."
"oh shit, nooooo, is someone going to spank me now?","nooooo, is someone going to spank me now?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Style Transfer Accuracy (1): The only toxic element was the profanity ""shit"". It has been removed, and the remaining sentence contains no offensive or derogatory language.
Content Similarity (1): Apart from deleting the profane expletive, all informational content (the interjection ""nooooo"" and the rhetorical question ""is someone going to spank me now?"") is kept intact. The attitude of alarm/distress is still conveyed; only the swear word is gone, which does not alter the core meaning.
Fluency (1): The resulting sentence is grammatical and easy to understand. The informal ‘nooooo’ is stylistically acceptable and poses no grammatical problem, so overall fluency is high."
steak Diane Please stop fucking up my edits on steak diane. Thank you.,Please stop up my edits on steak diane. Thank you.,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The explicit profanity ""fucking"" has been removed and no other toxic language is present, so the sentence is neutral (score 1). CS: The main idea—asking someone to cease negatively affecting the speaker’s edits— is partly preserved, but the phrase ""stop up my edits"" changes the meaning (""stop up"" implies blocking rather than ‘messing up’). Thus, some semantic loss occurs (score 0.5). FS: The sentence is grammatical, but the collocation ""stop up my edits"" is awkward and potentially confusing, reducing overall fluency and naturalness (score 0.5)."
You amins are such bastards.,You amins are such mean people.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The toxic slur ""bastards"" is replaced with the much milder phrase ""mean people,"" which is not considered toxic or profane. No other hateful or offensive wording remains, so toxic content is successfully removed. 

CS: The sentence still conveys the same opinion (the speaker thinks the addressees are unpleasant). No key information is lost—only the strength of the insult is softened—so the core meaning is preserved. 

FS: The sentence is understandable and grammatically acceptable overall, but the unusual phrase ""You amins"" (likely a misspelling of ""admins"") makes it sound awkward and slightly ungrammatical. Because of this minor fluency issue, the fluency score is reduced to 0.5 rather than a perfect 1.
"
"Quit Defacing my user page, you ugly cunt.-","Quit Defacing my user page, you ugly person.-",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The explicit slur ""cunt"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""person"", removing the main toxic element. However, the phrase still contains the pejorative adjective ""ugly"", so the sentence is not fully neutral. Hence partial detoxification → 0.5.
CS: Apart from the substitution of the slur, every other lexical unit and the overall intent (asking someone to stop defacing the user page while insulting them) are preserved. No core information is lost → 1.0.
FS: The sentence is fully understandable and grammatical. The capital D in ""Defacing"" and the trailing hyphen are minor stylistic issues but do not hinder readability → 1.0.
Joint score: (0.5 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
I forgot to mention the even sadder cunt that is,I forgot to mention the even worse person that is.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The slur ""cunt"" is fully removed and replaced with the neutral word ""person"". No other toxic language remains, so the style transfer accuracy is 1.
CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys that the speaker forgot to mention someone they view negatively (originally ""even sadder cunt"", now ""even worse person""). The core idea—forgetting to mention a disparaged individual—is preserved, so content similarity is 1.
FS: Although understandable, the sentence ""I forgot to mention the even worse person that is."" is grammatically awkward and feels incomplete (it would be more fluent as ""…who the even worse person is""). Because it has noticeable grammatical issues but remains comprehensible, fluency is scored at 0.5.
Overall, the joint score (average of the three dimensions) is (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83."
Randi was born a DICK.,Randi was born a mean person.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic insult ""DICK"" has been replaced with the neutral phrase ""mean person,"" fully removing the strong derogatory content, so STA = 1.
CS: Calling someone ""a dick"" colloquially means they are unpleasant or mean. The neutral version keeps this core meaning (Randi is an unpleasant person) with no significant loss of information, so CS = 1.
FS: ""Randi was born a mean person"" is grammatical, clear, and easy to understand. No evident errors, so FS = 1."
This is your last warning; stop being an asshole.,This is your last warning; stop being mean.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic word ""asshole"" has been replaced with the neutral term ""mean,"" eliminating all offensive language, so toxic content is fully removed (score 1).
CS: The rewritten sentence conveys the same core message—issuing a final warning and requesting a change in behavior—so the original meaning is completely preserved (score 1).
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, well-punctuated, and fully understandable, indicating high fluency (score 1)."
"MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WAHT I WANT I do not vandalize, so fuck you.","I do not vandalize, so please stop.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The toxic phrase ""fuck you"" and the aggressive all-caps shouting have been completely removed and replaced with the polite phrase ""please stop."" No residual toxicity remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the key idea that the speaker ""does not vandalize"" and asks the other party to stop, but it drops the information ""MY USER PAGE I WILL SAY WHAT I WANT,"" which expresses the speaker’s right to speak on their own page. Because part of the original meaning is lost, CS = 0.5.
FS: ""I do not vandalize, so please stop."" is a well-formed, grammatical sentence with natural wording. Therefore, FS = 1."
I am Nancy and I like to fuck up people's fun.,I am Nancy and I like to mess up people's fun.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity “fuck” has been replaced with the neutral verb phrase “mess up,” eliminating toxic language completely, so score = 1.
CS: The neutral sentence keeps all original information (speaker is Nancy, enjoys ruining people’s fun). Only the profane verb was softened while meaning stayed intact, so score = 1.
FS: The resulting sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and easily readable without awkward phrasing, so score = 1."
"Heh, look, not EVERYTHING is on google. you are a dumbass.","Heh, look, not EVERYTHING is on google. you are a",1.0,0.5,0.5,0.25,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the explicit insult ""dumbass,"" leaving no toxic or abusive language. Therefore, toxic style is fully neutralised (score 1).
CS: The original sentence conveys two pieces of information: (1) not everything is on Google, and (2) an insulting judgment of the addressee. The neutral version keeps the first proposition but drops the second (insult) altogether and leaves the clause ""you are a"" unfinished. Because part of the original (non-style) content is lost and the sentence fragment changes the message, only partial meaning preservation is achieved (score 0.5).
FS: The text is mostly readable, but the unfinished fragment ""you are a"" creates an obvious grammatical error and makes the sentence feel incomplete. It is still understandable, but not fully fluent (score 0.5)."
Thanks for being an ass when I tried to help.,Thanks for not helping when I tried to help.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The offensive term ""ass"" has been removed and no other toxic or insulting language remains, so the text is fully neutral.
CS: Both sentences convey sarcastic gratitude in the context of the speaker’s attempt to help, but the specific criticism changes from the addressee ""being an ass"" (rudeness) to ""not helping"" (inaction). The time frame and negative attitude are retained, yet the core accusation is altered, so only partial meaning is preserved.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and easily readable without awkward phrasing, thus fully fluent."
"You're a fucking moron, go read the notability guidelines.","You're not smart, go read the notability guidelines.",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The explicit profanity ('fucking moron') has been removed, but the phrase 'not smart' still directly insults the target, so the sentence is only partially detoxified.
CS: Aside from softening the insult, the neutral sentence retains the full core meaning (asserts lack of intelligence and instructs the reader to consult the notability guidelines), so content is completely preserved.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical and easy to read, with no noticeable errors, so fluency is high."
Some bubble tea for you! thanks ass hole,Some bubble tea for you! Thanks,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic term ""ass hole"" has been completely removed, leaving only neutral language, so full credit is given.
