Therefore, Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 0 because the output still contains clear toxic expression. Content Similarity is 1 because the corrected version preserves the original meaning perfectly—only fixing the spelling of 'tratening' to 'treating' and adding the missing 'to'—so the core message remains intact.

Content Similarity is 1.0 because the core meaning — that Nancy enjoys disrupting others' enjoyment — is fully preserved; 'ruining' accurately conveys the same intent as 'fuck up' in this context, and the self-identification remains unchanged. Fluency is 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any linguistic errors. The joint score is therefore the average of three perfect scores: (1+1+1)/3 = 1.0."

You are mistaken.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic content: the offensive term 'dumbass' is replaced with the neutral and polite 'mistaken,' and the overall tone is respectful while preserving the original intent. Thus, Style Transfer Accuracy is scored 1.0.

Thanks for being an ass when I tried to help.,Thanks for being difficult when I tried to help.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The toxic text contains the offensive term 'ass', which is used to express frustration toward someone's uncooperative behavior.

"You're a fucking moron, go read the notability guidelines.","You should go read the notability guidelines, you're not understanding them.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text successfully removes the explicit profanity ('fucking moron') and transforms the tone into a more civil suggestion, resulting in a fully neutral expression—thus, STA = 1. For Content Similarity (CS), while the core idea of advising someone to read the notability guidelines is preserved, the original text implies strong criticism of the person's intelligence and understanding, whereas the neutral version softens this into a mere misunderstanding. This downplays the speaker's intent and emotional emphasis, leading to partial meaning preservation—hence, CS = 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct, coherent, and clearly expressed without any linguistic errors—so FS = 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."

This results in a completely non-toxic and neutral tone, satisfying the Style Transfer Accuracy criterion (STA = 1). The core meaning—expressing gratitude while offering bubble tea—is fully preserved; the replacement does not alter the intent or key information, so Content Similarity is also fully maintained (CS = 1). The neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no fluency issues (FS = 1). Therefore, all three dimensions receive the highest score, leading to a joint score of 1."
And your dumb people fell for his shenanigans.,And your naive people fell for his tricks.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully removes the toxic content: 'dumb people' is replaced with 'naive people' and 'shenanigans' with 'tricks', both of which are non-offensive alternatives. The language is now completely neutral, satisfying the Style Transfer Accuracy criterion (score: 1). The core meaning is preserved — the original idea that certain people were deceived by someone's deceptive behavior remains intact, so Content Similarity is fully maintained (score: 1).

These people are INSANE.,These people are crazy.,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the toxic text uses 'INSANE' in all caps, which conveys strong negative emotion and can be considered toxic. The neutral text replaces it with 'crazy', which is less intense but still carries a negative and potentially judgmental connotation. 'Crazy' is not fully neutral and may still be seen as a mild insult, so the detoxification is only partial, warranting a 0.5. For Content Similarity (CS), the core meaning—that the speaker views these people as mentally irrational or extreme—is preserved without addition or omission, so the score is 1. For Fluency (FS), the neutral sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, so it receives a 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (0.5 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."

Therefore, STA is scored 1.0. For Content Similarity (CS), while the general intent of expressing a negative judgment about appearance is preserved, the intensity and emotional impact are significantly reduced. The original text is extremely derogatory, whereas the rewritten version is comparatively mild, leading to a partial loss of the original meaning. Hence, CS is scored 0.5. For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and natural-sounding, with no issues in readability or expression, warranting a score of 1.0. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."
Be careful who you call a moron.,Be careful who you label as unintelligent.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The neutral text successfully replaces the toxic term 'moron' with the more neutral and respectful term 'unintelligent', effectively removing the offensive language while maintaining a completely neutral tone, thus achieving full style transfer accuracy (STA = 1).

"Stop defending pedophiles, faggot.",Stop defending individuals who engage in inappropriate behavior.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text successfully removes all toxic language, including the offensive slur 'faggot' and the emotionally charged, stigmatizing term 'pedophiles,' replacing them with the more neutral and socially acceptable phrase 'individuals who engage in inappropriate behavior.' The resulting text is completely free of toxic expressions. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the core idea of 'defending controversial or socially condemned individuals' is preserved, the specific reference to 'pedophiles'—a precise and serious accusation—is generalized to 'inappropriate behavior,' which is vaguer and less specific. This results in a partial loss of the original meaning, particularly the severity and specificity of the accusation. Fluency (FS) is scored 1.0 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any linguistic errors or awkwardness."
"No one is vandalizing assholes, so get it straight!!!","No one is vandalizing, so get it straight!",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"For Style Transfer Accuracy (STA), the neutral text successfully removes the toxic term 'assholes', replacing the offensive expression with a clean, neutral version.

For Fluency (FS), the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally, so it receives a score of 1. The joint score is the average of the three: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 = 0.83."

He deserves every beating and rape he will be subjected to.,He deserves to face consequences for his actions.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"Style Transfer Accuracy (STA) is scored 1 because the neutral text completely removes the toxic content—specifically the violent and sexually abusive language ('every beating and rape')—and rephrases the sentiment in a socially acceptable and neutral manner. The resulting sentence contains no offensive or harmful expressions. Content Similarity (CS) is scored 0.5 because while the general idea that the person should face negative consequences is preserved, the original text expresses a specific, extreme, and personal form of retribution (beating and rape), which is significantly downplayed in the neutral version. The core sentiment of deserving punishment is retained, but the intensity and specificity are lost, leading to partial meaning preservation. Fluency (FS) is scored 1 because the neutral text is grammatically correct, clear, and reads naturally without any linguistic errors.
