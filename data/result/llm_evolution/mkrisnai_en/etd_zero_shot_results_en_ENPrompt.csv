are they liars or just clueless ?,are they dishonest or just unaware?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The insulting words “liars” and “clueless” have been replaced by the milder, non-pejorative terms “dishonest” and “unaware.” The rewritten sentence no longer contains overtly toxic or demeaning language, so a full score of 1 is awarded.

FS: The output is an understandable, well-formed question with correct syntax and punctuation. Although it begins with a lowercase letter, this is a minor stylistic choice rather than a grammatical error, so the sentence is judged fully fluent (score 1)."
"as someone from la and an oilfield worker , i still say this guy is a piece of shit .","As someone from LA and an oilfield worker, I still think this guy is not a good person.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive phrase ""piece of shit"" has been replaced with the neutral phrase ""not a good person,"" fully eliminating profanity or hateful language.

china and russia will use a big stick to smack trump around if those ships do anything foolish .,China and Russia will use strong measures to handle Trump if those ships do anything foolish.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The violent, clearly toxic phrase ""use a big stick to smack Trump around"" has been replaced with the neutral phrasing ""use strong measures to handle Trump."" No aggressive or insulting wording remains, so toxic content is fully removed.

cretins like this rarely care about facts ., individuals like this rarely care about facts.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The offensive word ""cretins"" has been replaced with the neutral term ""individuals,"" so all toxic language is removed (score 1).
CS: Aside from the substitution of a neutral descriptor, the proposition ""like this rarely care about facts"" is intact; no information has been lost (score 1).
FS: The sentence is easily understandable and grammatically correct in structure, but it begins with an unnecessary leading space and a lowercase initial letter, which deviates from standard sentence-level capitalization. This minor formatting/grammar issue warrants a slight deduction (score 0.5)."

Therefore, STA = 1. 
CS: The neutral sentence keeps the main request (do not change my edits) and the idea that there will be a negative reaction if the request is ignored. However, it drops the specific action of coming to the person's house and cutting them. This is a significant loss of information beyond mere toxicity, so only partial meaning is preserved. Hence CS = 0.5.

FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, capitalizes GRE and ‘I,’ and reads naturally, so fluency is perfect (1). Therefore the joint score, the average of the three aspects, is 1.0."

FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical, readable, and natural. Minor stylistic choices such as lowercase initial “have” do not hinder fluency. Hence FS = 1."
"holy shit , a cop got fired ? .","wow, a cop got fired?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit profanity 'holy shit' has been fully replaced with the neutral exclamation 'wow'; no toxic or profane language remains, so the style transfer is complete.
CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the core information (surprise that a police officer was fired) and the interrogative tone, so the original meaning is entirely preserved.
FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatically correct, and perfectly readable ('Wow, a cop got fired?'). Therefore, it is fully fluent."
how the fuck do you manage that ? .,how do you manage that?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the explicit profanity ('the fuck') and contains no other toxic language, achieving full detoxification, so score = 1.

CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the idea that the speaker misread the title as “laser machete” and had a strong reaction. However, the emotional intensity changes from extreme fear/disgust (“almost shit my pants”) to mild surprise. Because part of the original nuance is lost, only partial preservation → 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is well-formed, correctly capitalised, and grammatically sound with no awkward phrasing → 1."
i did not vandalize anything you dick .,"I did not vandalize anything, you jerk.",0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,"STA: The original toxic slur ""you dick"" has been toned down to ""you jerk,"" which is still an insult, though milder.

CS: All semantic content is preserved: praise for the pope being cool/awesome and the speaker’s emphasis with ""seriously."" Minor lexical changes (""awesome"" → ""great"", omission of filler ""and stuff"") do not alter meaning, so CS = 1.
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical, coherent, and natural-sounding. No awkward phrasing or errors are present, so FS = 1.

Therefore, toxic content is fully eliminated (score = 1).

FS: The neutral text is grammatically correct, easily understandable and natural-sounding. Minor punctuation issues (missing capital ""L"", optional comma) do not impede readability – score 1."
"liar , liar pants on fire justin .","liar, liar pants on fire justin.",0.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"STA: The neutral text still calls Justin a ""liar"" and repeats the childish insult ""liar, liar, pants on fire,"" so no toxic content has been removed. Hence 0.

CS: The rewritten sentence conveys exactly the same idea—complete disbelief that a certain number of bricks can fit in a car—so the core meaning is preserved, yielding CS = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable, but it contains a grammatical flaw (“that number bricks” should be “that number of bricks” or “that many bricks”) and uses a comma splice between two independent clauses. These issues reduce smoothness, so FS = 0.5."

FS: The sentence is grammatical, reads naturally, and is easy to understand. Although it begins with a lowercase letter, this minor capitalization issue does not hinder fluency, so FS = 1.

nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look shady as fuck .,nothing but missing footage is sure going to make whatever happened during that unaccounted for time look suspicious.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profanity ""as fuck"" has been removed and replaced with the neutral word ""suspicious,"" eliminating all toxic language.

CS: The neutral sentence conveys the same idea: that the absence of footage will make the events during the unaccounted-for period appear dubious. Only the intensity of the adjective changes, but the core meaning is intact, so full credit (1).
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatical and easily readable. Although the structure is slightly informal, there are no real grammatical errors or disfluencies, warranting full fluency (1)."
number will solve alot of fucking problems if it comes down to it .,number will solve a lot of problems if it comes down to it.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the swear word ""fucking"". It has been completely removed, leaving no toxic or aggressive language. Therefore the style transfer accuracy is 1.

Joint score: (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.83"
org there s wikipedia articles for all sorts of random shit like this .,org there are Wikipedia articles for all sorts of random topics like this.,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,"STA: The only toxic element in the source is the word ""shit."" It has been replaced with the neutral word ""topics,"" removing all toxicity. Therefore, Style Transfer Accuracy = 1.
CS: Apart from the lexical substitution of ""shit""→""topics,"" all information (existence of Wikipedia articles for many random X) is preserved. Hence Content Similarity = 1.
FS: The sentence is understandable and largely grammatical, but begins with the lowercase token ""org,"" which makes the construction slightly awkward and arguably incomplete punctuation-wise (a comma after ""org"" or a clearer subject would be expected). Because of this minor fluency issue, Fluency = 0.5 rather than 1.
Joint score is the arithmetic mean of the three sub-scores: (1 + 1 + 0.5)/3 ≈ 0.83."
"ouch man , them swedes were dicks to norway =\","ouch man, those Swedes were mean to Norway =\",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic term ""dicks"" has been replaced with the neutral word ""mean,"" so all explicit toxicity is removed; therefore STA = 1.

CS: The neutral sentence keeps the core idea that people misuse emergency call time for trivial matters; only intensity is softened but meaning is intact (score 1). FS: The sentence is understandable, but it begins with a lowercase letter and the phrase ""use ... wisely on"" is slightly awkward; these minor issues lower fluency (score 0.5). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions."
"quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some idiot hierarch , even unto being killed , like st .","quite a few saints are canonized because they opposed some foolish leader, even to the point of being killed, like St.",0.5,1.0,0.5,0.25,"STA: The clearly toxic term ""idiot"" has been softened to ""foolish"", which is less harsh but still a negative personal descriptor. The sentence is thus only partially detoxified, so 0.5 is appropriate.
CS: Apart from changing the insulting word and modernising a couple of phrases (""unto"" → ""to the point of""), the neutral text conveys exactly the same factual content: many saints were canonised for opposing a leader and were killed for it. Therefore content is fully preserved → 1.
FS: The sentence is mostly readable, but ends awkwardly with ""like St."" (missing the saint’s full name) and has a slightly clunky structure. These minor issues lower fluency, yet it remains understandable, so 0.5.
Joint score: (0.5 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.67."
read your own fucking link .,read your own link.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The only toxic element in the source sentence is the expletive ""fucking"". The neutral version removes this word entirely, leaving no remaining toxicity, thus STA = 1.

CS: All core information is kept: something identical is occurring, and the location (pnw → Pacific Northwest) is even clarified. No meaning is lost, so CS = 1.
FS: While understandable, the sentence is a fragment: it lacks the auxiliary verb ""is"" (""Same thing is happening…""). Additionally, it begins with a lowercase letter. These minor grammatical issues lower fluency, so FS = 0.5."
"shit , i d love an number pm sunset .","Wow, I would love a sunset at that time.",1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The profane word ""shit"" is completely removed and replaced with the neutral exclamation ""Wow,"" so the sentence is fully detoxified (score 1). CS: The core idea—speaker expresses enthusiasm for seeing the sunset at a certain time—is kept, but the original mentions an unspecified “number pm” (e.g., 6 pm) that is omitted, so part of the information is lost (score 0.5). FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, coherent and natural-sounding (score 1). The joint score is the average of the three dimensions: (1 + 0.5 + 1) / 3 ≈ 0.83."

The rewritten sentence is fully neutral and contains no toxic or derogatory language.
Content Similarity (1): All non-toxic factual information is preserved: someone robbed a liquor store, the amount taken was $400, and the person ends up in prison.

Fluency (1): The neutral sentence is grammatical, coherent, and easily understandable with natural wording and no errors."
"someone says no , and they say fuck off we need vets only for free housing ? .","someone says no, and they say we only need veterans for free housing?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit toxic phrase ""fuck off"" has been removed and no other offensive language remains, so the output is fully neutral.

FS: The neutral sentence is short, grammatically acceptable, and easily understandable. Minor stylistic awkwardness (comma splice, rhetorical question) does not impede comprehension, so it meets the criterion for full fluency."
still standing up for your lying crazy leader who loves himself and nobody else .,still supporting your leader who is dishonest and self-centered.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA (1): The toxic phrases ""lying"" and ""crazy"" were replaced with the more neutral adjectives ""dishonest"" and ""self-centered."" These alternatives convey criticism without using slurs or overtly toxic language, so toxicity is effectively removed.
CS (1): The rewritten sentence keeps every core idea: (a) the addressee is still supporting/standing up for their leader; (b) the leader is untruthful (lying → dishonest); (c) the leader is egocentric (loves himself and nobody else → self-centered). No essential information is lost.

CS: The meaning — that something was extremely poor compared with anything before — is completely preserved (""sucked like nothing's ever sucked before"" → ""was really bad, worse than anything before"").
FS: The sentence is understandable and grammatical at the phrase level, but it lacks an explicit subject, making it a fragment rather than a full sentence. Because of this minor fluency issue, it earns 0.5 instead of 1.
Overall, the joint score (average of the three sub-scores) is (1 + 1 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.83."
taking a stand with either party is equally retarded .,Taking a stand with either party is equally foolish.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The offensive slur ""retarded"" has been replaced by the neutral adjective ""foolish,"" eliminating the toxic content entirely.

FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct, uses proper punctuation, and reads naturally, demonstrating full fluency.

CS: The rewritten sentence keeps the two main ideas – (1) the speaker says it is a joke and (2) questions the addressees' behavior.

Because this semantic nuance is lost, only partial meaning preservation is achieved – score 0.5.

Minor lexical shifts (""loads of"" → ""many"") do not alter meaning, hence CS = 1. FS: The rewritten sentence is understandable and largely grammatical, but it still begins with a lowercase ""yeah,"" and the trailing question mark makes the sentence slightly awkward as a statement.

CS: The sentence still conveys that the speaker has a negative opinion of free speech; the strength of sentiment is slightly softened but the core meaning (disapproval) is intact → 1.
FS: The sentence is easily understandable, but it contains a comma splice between two independent clauses (""I dislike free speech, it is not good""). This punctuation error lowers grammatical correctness, so fluency is marked as partially fluent → 0.5."
"Minority Breeder Breeder is a significant person and you went and deleted the page started for him, nice job dipshit.","Minority Breeder is an important figure and you deleted the page that was created for him, well done.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The explicit insult “dipshit” is removed and replaced with the neutral phrase “well done.” No other toxic or abusive wording remains, so the detoxification is complete.
CS: All core information is kept: (1) the subject (Minority Breeder), (2) his importance, and (3) that the listener deleted a page created for him. Minor wording changes (e.g., ‘significant person’ → ‘important figure’) do not alter meaning, and removal of the duplicated word “Breeder” does not lose information. Hence full preservation.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatical and easy to understand. Although the comma before “well done” forms a mild comma splice, it does not impede readability, so fluency is rated fully fluent.

FS: Both sentences are grammatical, clear, and natural. The only minor issue is a comma splice between two independent clauses in the second sentence, but it does not impede readability. The text reads fluently overall, so FS = 1."

CS (0.5): The rewritten sentence keeps the core idea of addressing the same people and labeling them negatively, but the specific reference ‘amins’ (likely a subgroup such as ‘admins’) is generalized to ‘guys’.

CS: The rewritten sentence still conveys the same message (telling the person to leave and labeling them ""incel""). No core information is lost, so full preservation is achieved. FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and easily readable; it could benefit from a comma before ""incel,"" but this is a minor stylistic issue, so fluency is judged as fully acceptable."
"Stop defending pedophiles, faggot.",Stop defending individuals who engage in inappropriate behavior.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The explicit slur ""faggot"" is removed and the wording is neutral, so toxic content has been fully eliminated, yielding a score of 1.
CS: The original sentence specifically refers to ""pedophiles,"" whereas the neutral text generalizes this to ""individuals who engage in inappropriate behavior."" While the imperative to stop defending such people is retained, the concrete target (pedophiles) is lost, so only partial meaning is preserved (0.5).
FS: The rewritten sentence is grammatically correct, clear, and natural: it reads smoothly with no errors, so fluency merits a 1."
"No one is vandalizing assholes, so get it straight!!!","No one is vandalizing, so get it straight!",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The toxic term ""assholes"" has been completely removed, and the remaining sentence contains no other slurs or harassment, so the detoxification is fully successful. 
CS: The essential meaning—asserting that no one is vandalizing and urging the listener to understand—remains intact; the removed word was merely an insult, not core information. 
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and easy to read; punctuation and wording are appropriate. Hence, all three dimensions receive the maximum score."
"DUDE CALM THE FUCK DOWN!!!
","Dude, please calm down.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral sentence removes the profanity ""FUCK"" and any aggressive tone, replacing it with a polite formulation. No toxic content remains, so STA = 1.
CS: The core intent—telling someone to calm down—is fully preserved. Adding ""please"" does not change the meaning, so CS = 1.
FS: ""Dude, please calm down."" is grammatically correct, well-punctuated, and perfectly readable, so FS = 1."
"Some jackass vandalized the article again, can someone fix it?","Someone vandalized the article again, can someone fix it?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The neutral text removes the toxic insult ""jackass"" and uses neutral wording, fully eliminating toxicity, so STA = 1. 
CS: Aside from replacing the insult with a neutral pronoun, the sentence keeps all substantive information (someone vandalized the article again, request for help), so meaning is completely preserved, CS = 1.
FS: The neutral sentence is grammatically correct and fully fluent, FS = 1."
I'm afraid I can't verify it as his myspace account has been deleted I fucking hate you.,I'm afraid I can't verify it as his myspace account has been deleted. I really dislike you.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"STA: The profane phrase “fucking hate you” is replaced with the neutral phrase “really dislike you.” No profanity or slurs remain, so the toxic style is fully removed. 
CS: All factual content (inability to verify because the MySpace account was deleted) and the speaker’s negative sentiment toward the listener are retained. The strength of the sentiment is softened (hate → dislike) but the core meaning—expressing negative feeling—remains. Therefore, meaning preservation is considered complete. 
FS: The neutral text is grammatically correct, properly punctuated, and easy to read. No awkward phrasing or errors are present, so fluency is fully satisfactory."
He deserves every beating and rape he will be subjected to.,He deserves to face consequences for his actions.,1.0,0.5,1.0,0.5,"STA: The original sentence contains explicit violent and sexual threats (“beating and rape”). The rewritten sentence removes all references to violence and sexual assault and uses a neutral phrasing (“face consequences”), so the toxic content is fully removed → 1.
CS: Both sentences convey that the person is thought to deserve some form of punishment. However, the specific, extreme nature of the punishment (beating and rape) is lost in the neutral version. Therefore, the main idea (deserving punishment) is retained, but important details are omitted → 0.5.
FS: The neutral sentence is concise, grammatical, and easy to understand; no fluency problems are present → 1."
